    <h2>
      CHAPTER I&mdash;A CASE IS STATED.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N more than one
      account the 25th of April will always be a notable anniversary in the
      calendar of Mr. Arthur Ripley. To begin with, on that day he pocketed his
      first serious retainer as a lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got down-town a little late that morning. The weather was superb&mdash;blue
      sky and summer temperature. Central Park was within easy walking distance.
      His own engagements, alas, were not pressing. So he had treated himself to
      an afterbreakfast ramble across the common.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering his office, toward eleven o&rsquo;clock, he was surprised to find
      the usually empty chairs already tenanted. Mr. Mendel, the brewer, was
      established there, in company with two other gentlemen whom Arthur did not
      recognize. The sight of these visitors caused the young man a palpitation.
      Could it be&mdash;? He dared not complete the thought. That a client had
      at last sought him out, was too agreeable an hypothesis to be entertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mendel greeted him with the effusiveness for which he is
      distinguished, and introduced his companions respectively as Mr. Peixada
      and Mr. Rimo. Of old time, when Arthur&rsquo;s father was still alive, and when
      Arthur himself had trotted about in knee-breeches and short jackets, Mr.
      Mendel had been their next door neighbor. Now he made the lawyer feel
      undignified by asking a string of personal questions: &ldquo;Vail, how iss
      mamma?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Not married yet, eh?&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Lieber Gott!</i> You must be
      five-and-twenty&mdash;so tall, and with dot long mustache&mdash;yes?&rdquo; And
      so forth; smiling the while with such benevolence that Arthur could not
      help answering politely, though he did hope that a desire for family
      statistics was not the sole motive of the brewer&rsquo;s visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by and by Mendel cleared his throat, and assumed a look of importance.
      His voice modulated into a graver key, as he announced, &ldquo;The fact is that
      we&mdash;or rather, my friends, Mr. Peixada and Mr. Rimo&mdash;want to
      consult you about a little matter of business.&rdquo; He leaned back in his
      chair, drawing a deep breath, as though the speech had exhausted him;
      mopped his brow with his handkerchief, and flourished his thumb toward
      Peixada.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; replied Arthur, bowing to the latter, &ldquo;I am happy to be at your
      service, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Peixada, in a voice several sizes larger than the situation
      required, &ldquo;Mr. Mendel recommends you to us as a young man who is smart,
      and who, at the same time, is not so busy but that he can bestow upon our
      affairs the attention we wish them to have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding Arthur&rsquo;s delight at the prospect of something to do,
      Peixada&rsquo;s tone, a mixture as it was of condescension and imperiousness,
      jarred a little. Arthur did not like the gratuitous assumption that he was
      &ldquo;not so busy,&rdquo; etc., true though it might be; nor did he like the critical
      way in which Peixada eyed him. &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he said, speaking of it
      afterward, &ldquo;it gave me very much such a sensation as a fellow must
      experience when put up for sale in the Turkish slave market&mdash;a
      feeling that my &rsquo;points&rsquo; were being noted, and my money value computed. I
      half expected him to continue, &rsquo;Open your mouth, show your teeth!&rsquo;.rdquo;
       Peixada was a tall, portly individual of fifty-odd, with a swarthy skin,
      brown, beady eyes, a black coat upon his back, and a fat gold ring around
      his middle finger. The top of his head was as bald as a Capuchin&rsquo;s, and
      shone like a disk of varnished box-wood. It was surrounded by a circlet of
      crisp, dark, curly hair. He had a solemn manner that proclaimed him to be
      a person of consequence. It turned out that he was president of a
      one-horse insurance company. Mr. Rimo appeared to be but slightly in
      advance of Arthur&rsquo;s own age&mdash;a tiny strip of a body, wearing a
      resplendent cravat, a dotted waistcoat, pointed patent-leather gaiters,
      and finger-nails trimmed talon-shape&mdash;a thoroughbred New York dandy,
      of the least effeminate type.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose the name, Peixada,&rdquo; the elder of the pair went on, &ldquo;is not
      wholly unfamiliar to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;by no means,&rdquo; Arthur assented, wondering whether he had ever
      heard it before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose the circumstances of my brother&rsquo;s death are still fresh in your
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur put on an intelligent expression, and inwardly deplored his
      ignorance. Yet&mdash;Peixada?
    </p>
    <p>
      Peixada? the name did have a familiar ring, of a truth. But where and in
      what connection had he heard it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; he ventured, &ldquo;that was in&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In July, &rsquo;seventy-nine&mdash;recollect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, yes; to be sure; he recollected. So this man was a brother of the
      Peixada who, rather less than half a dozen years ago, had been murdered,
      and whose murder had set New York agog. In a general way Arthur recalled
      the glaring accounts of the matter that had appeared in the newspapers at
      the time. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, feeling that it behooved him to say something,
      &ldquo;it was very sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fearful!&rdquo; put in Mr. Mendel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Peixada resumed, in his pompous style, &ldquo;of course you
      followed the trial as it was reported in the public prints; but perhaps
      you have forgotten the particulars. Had I better refresh your memory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be a good idea,&rdquo; said Arthur.&mdash;To what was the way being
      paved?
    </p>
    <p>
      With the air of performing a ceremony, Peixada rose, unbuttoned his coat,
      extracted a bulky envelope from the inner pocket, re-seated himself, and
      handed the envelope to Arthur. It proved to contain newspaper clippings.
      &ldquo;Please glance them through,&rdquo; said Peixada.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Peixada murder had been a sensational and peculiarly revolting affair.
      One July night, 1879, Mr. Bernard Peixada, &ldquo;a retired Jewish merchant,&rdquo;
       had died at the hands of his wife. Edward Bolen, coachman, in the attempt
      to protect his employer, had sustained a death-wound for himself. Mrs.
      Peixada, &ldquo;the perpetrator of these atrocities,&rdquo; as Arthur gathered from
      the records now beneath his eye, &ldquo;was a young and handsome woman, of a
      respectable Hebrew family, who must have been actuated by a depraved
      desire to possess herself of her husband&rsquo;s wealth.&rdquo; They had &ldquo;surprised
      her all but red-handed in the commission of the crime,&rdquo; though &ldquo;too late
      to avert its dire results.&rdquo; Eventually she was tried in the Court of
      General Sessions, and acquitted on the plea of insanity. Arthur remembered&mdash;as,
      perhaps, the reader does&mdash;that her acquittal had been the subject of
      much popular indignation. &ldquo;She is no more insane than you or I,&rdquo; every
      body had said; &ldquo;she is simply lacking in the moral sense. Another evidence
      that you can&rsquo;t get a jury to be impartial when a pretty woman is
      concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was bad,&rdquo; continued Peixada, as Arthur returned the papers, &ldquo;bad
      through and through. I warned my brother against her before his marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What,&rsquo; said I, &rsquo;what do you suppose she would marry an old man like you
      for, except your money?&rsquo; He said, &rsquo;Never mind.&rsquo; She was young and showy,
      and Bernard lost his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was doocedly handsome, a sooperb creature to look at, you know,&rdquo;
       cried Mr. Rimo, with the accent of a connoisseur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hainsome is as hainsome does,&rdquo; quoth Mr. Mendel, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was as cold as ice, as hard as alabaster,&rdquo; said Peixada, perhaps
      meaning adamant. &ldquo;The point is that after her release from prison she took
      out letters of administration upon my brother&rsquo;s estate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I thought she was insane,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;A mad woman would not be a
      competent administratrix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. I interposed objections on that ground. But she answered that
      she had recovered; that although insane a few months before&mdash;at the
      time of the murder&mdash;she was all right again now. The surrogate
      decided in her favor. A convenient form of insanity, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were there children?&rdquo; Arthur inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;none. My nephew, Mr. Rimo, son of my sister who is dead, and I
      myself, were the only next of kin. She paid us our shares right away.&rdquo;
       Then what could he be driving at now? Arthur waited for enlightenment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now,&rdquo; Peixada presently went on, &ldquo;now I have discovered that my
      brother left a will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I understand. You wish to have it admitted to probate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. But first I wish to find Mrs. Peixada. The will isn&rsquo;t worth
      the paper it&rsquo;s written on, unless we can get hold of her. You see, she has
      about half the property in her possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no real estate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not an acre; but the personalty amounted to a good many thousands of
      dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t know where she is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t an idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you made any efforts to find out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should say I had&mdash;made every effort in my power. That&rsquo;s what
      brings me here. I want you to carry on the search.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t imagine it would be hard work. A woman&mdash;a widow&mdash;of
      wealth is always a conspicuous object&mdash;trebly so, when she is
      handsome too, and has been tried for murder. But tell me, what, have you
      done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be surprised when you hear. I myself supposed it would be plain
      sailing. But listen.&rdquo; Peixada donned a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles,
      opened a red leather memorandum-book, and read aloud from its pages. The
      substance of what he read was this. He had begun by visiting Mrs.
      Peixada&rsquo;s attorneys, Messrs. Short and Sondheim, the firm that had
      defended her at her trial. With them he got his labor for his pains. They
      had held no communication with the lady in question since early in
      January, 1881, at which date they had settled her accounts before the
      surrogate. She was then traveling from place to place in Europe. Her last
      letter, postmarked Vienna, had said that for the next two months her
      address would be <i>poste restante</i> at the same city. From the office
      of Short and Sondheim Mr. Peixada went to the office of his
      sister-in-law&rsquo;s surety, the Eagle and Phoenix Trust Company, No.&mdash;Broadway.
      There he was referred to the secretary, Mr. Oxford. Mr. Oxford told him
      that the Company had never had any personal dealings with the
      administratrix, she having acted throughout by her attorneys. The Company
      had required the entire assets of the estate to be deposited in its
      vaults, and had honored drafts only on the advice of counsel. Thus
      protected, the Company had had no object in keeping the administratrix in
      view. Our inquirer next bethought him of Mrs. Peixada&rsquo;s personal friends&mdash;people
      who would be likely still to maintain relations with her&mdash;and saw
      such of these as he could get at. One and all professed ignorance of her
      whereabouts&mdash;had not heard of her or from her since the winter of &rsquo;80&mdash;&rsquo;81.
      Finally it occurred to him that as his brother&rsquo;s estate had consisted
      solely of stocks and bonds, he could by properly directed investigations
      learn to what corner of the world Mrs. Peixada&rsquo;s dividends were sent. But
      this last resort also proved a failure. The stocks and bonds, specified in
      the surrogate&rsquo;s inventory, had been sold out. He could find no clew to the
      reinvestments made of the money realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peixada closed his note-book with a snap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been pretty thorough and pretty unsuccessful.
      Can you think of any stone that I have left unturned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about relatives? Have you questioned her relatives?&rdquo; asked Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of relatives&mdash;in America, at least&mdash;Mrs. P. has none. Her
      father died shortly after her marriage. Her mother died during the trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But uncles, aunts, sister, brothers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None to my knowledge. She was an only child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her maiden-name was&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Karon&mdash;Judith Karon. Her father, Michael Karon, used to keep a
      jewelry store on Second Avenue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what is her age?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was twenty-one at the time of the murder. That would make her
      twenty-five or six now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So young, indeed? Have you a photograph of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A photograph? No. I don&rsquo;t know that she ever sat for one. But I have
      these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peixada produced a couple of rough wood-engravings, apparently cuttings
      from illustrated papers, and submitted them for examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t look any thing like each other,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;Does either of
      them look like her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; Peixada answered. &ldquo;In fact, the resemblance is so slight that
      they wouldn&rsquo;t assist at all in identifying her. On the contrary, I think
      they&rsquo;d lead you quite astray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Said Mr. Rimo, &ldquo;Bah! They give you no more idea of her than they do of
      Queen Victoria. They&rsquo;d answer for any other woman just as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad. But I suppose you have brought a copy of the
      will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, here&rsquo;s the original. It is in my brother&rsquo;s handwriting, dated a
      month before his death, and witnessed by two gentlemen of high standing. I
      have spoken to each of them. They acknowledge their signatures, and
      remember the circumstances. I made a search for a will right after Bernard
      died, but could find none. This I unearthed most unexpectedly. I was
      turning over the leaves of my poor brother&rsquo;s prayer-book, when, there it
      was, lying between the pages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The will was brief and vigorous. In the name of God, amen, (on a
      half-sheet of legal-cap), it devised and bequeathed all the property, real
      or personal, of which testator should die seized or possessed, to his
      dearly beloved brother, Benjamin Peixada, and his dearly beloved nephew,
      Maurice Rimo, for them to hold and enjoy the same, in fee simple, share
      and share alike, absolutely and forever, provided that they should pay
      annually to testator&rsquo;s widow, (until such time as she should re-marry, or
      depart this life), the sum of three hundred dollars. It was attested by a
      well-known Jewish physician and by a well-known Jewish banker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would seem from this,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;that your brother got bravely
      over his illusions concerning his wife. It&rsquo;s lucky he had no real estate.
      She would be entitled to her dower, you know, as a matter of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know; and I guess that was the reason why my brother converted all
      his real estate into personalty shortly after his marriage&mdash;so that
      he could dispose of it as he chose. The reference to real estate here in
      the will is doubtless an inadvertence. He was probably following a form.
      He couldn&rsquo;t trust his wife. She made his life wretched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Arthur began&mdash;but Peixada interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you,&rdquo; he said in his dictatorial way, &ldquo;to name a sum for which you
      will undertake to continue this investigation and bring it to a successful
      issue; that is, find Mrs. P., have the will proved, and compel her to
      refund the property&mdash;upwards of one hundred thousand dollars, unless
      she has squandered it&mdash;that remains subject to her control.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t name a lump sum off-hand,&rdquo; replied Arthur, &ldquo;neither can I
      guarantee success. I would of course do my utmost to succeed, but there is
      always the chance of failure. The amount of my compensation would be
      determined by the time I should have to spend, and the difficulties I
      should have to encounter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds reasonable. Then suppose I should agree to defray all
      expenses by the way, pay a fee, as you suggest, proportionate to your
      service at the end, and now at the outset give you a retainer of&mdash;say
      two hundred and fifty dollars; would you be satisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur&rsquo;s heart leaped. But to exhibit his true emotions would be
      unprofessional. He constrained himself to answer quietly, &ldquo;Yes, I should
      be satisfied.&rdquo; It was, however, with a glow of genuine enthusiasm for his
      client that he folded up a check for the tidy sum of two hundred and fifty
      dollars, and tucked it into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Peixada, &ldquo;I shall trust the entire management of this business to
      your discretion. Only one thing I shall suggest. I think an adroitly
      worded advertisement in the principal newspapers of this country and
      Europe&mdash;an advertisement that would lead the reader to suppose that
      we felt friendly toward Mrs. P.&mdash;would be a wise measure. For
      instance, a notice to the effect that she could learn something to her
      advantage by communicating with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that would be scarcely honorable, would it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honorable? In dealing with a murderess&mdash;with a woman, moreover, who
      is enjoying wealth not rightly hers&mdash;talk about honorable! All means
      are fair by which to catch a thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even so, she would be too shrewd to take the bait. An advertisement
      would merely put her on her guard. Mustn&rsquo;t bell the cat, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one way of considering it. On the other hand&mdash;However, I
      simply offer the suggestion; you&rsquo;re the pilot and can take whatever course
      you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, we&rsquo;ll reserve our advertisement till other expedients have
      failed. The first thing to do is&mdash;&rdquo; But Arthur stopped himself. He
      did not clearly know what the first thing to do was. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about
      it,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Peixada, rising; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing further for me to detain
      you with to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give my regards to mamma, when you write, Arthur,&rdquo; said Mr. Mendel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leave you my memoranda,&rdquo; said Peixada, laying his note-book upon
      Arthur&rsquo;s desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care of yourself,&rdquo; enjoined Mr. Rimo, smiling and waving his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three gentlemen filed out. Arthur remained seated in his arm-chair a
      long while after their departure, his eyes fixed upon the wall, his
      fingers busily twirling his mustache. For three years he had been enrolled
      among the members of the bar. This was the first case he had received that
      seemed really worthy of his talents.

      CHAPTER II.&mdash;&ldquo;A VOICE, A MYSTERY.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>RTHUR RIPLEY&mdash;good-natured,
      impressionable, unpractical Arthur Ripley, as his familiars called him&mdash;dwelt
      in Beekman Place. Beek-man Place, as the reader may not know, is a short,
      chocolate-colored, unpretentious thoroughfare, perched on the eastern
      brink of Manhattan Island, and commanding a fine view of the river, of the
      penitentiary, and of the oil factories at Hunter&rsquo;s Point. Arthur and a
      friend of his, Mr. Julian Hetzel, kept house in the two upper stories of
      No. 43, an old German woman named Josephine acting as their
      maid-of-all-work. They had a kitchen, a dining-room, a parlor, two airy
      dormitories, a light closet which did duty for a guest-chamber; and over
      and above all, they had the roof. Upon the roof Hetzel had swung a
      hammock, and in earthen pots round about had ranged an assortment of
      flowering shrubs; so that by courtesy the roof was commonly styled the <i>loggia</i>.
      Here, toward sundown on that summery April day mentioned in the last
      chapter, the chums were seated, sipping their after-dinner coffee and
      smoking their after-dinner cigarettes. They could not have wished for a
      pleasanter spot for their pleasant occupation. By fits and starts a sweet
      breeze puffed up from the south. Westward the sun was sinking into a
      crimson fury. Eastward the horizon glowed with a delicate pink light.
      Below them, on one side, stretched the river&mdash;tinted like
      mother-o&rsquo;-pearl by the ruddy sky overhead&mdash;-up which a procession of
      Sound steamboats was sweeping in stately single file. On the other side
      lay the street, clamorous with the voices of many children at sport.
      Around the corner, an itinerant band was playing selections from
      Trovatore. Blatant and faulty though the music was, softened by distance,
      it had a quite agreeable effect. Of course, the topic of conversation was
      Arthur&rsquo;s case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel said, &ldquo;It will be slow work, and tedious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; retorted Arthur, &ldquo;it seems to me to furnish an
      opportunity for brilliant strategy. I must get a clew, you know, and then
      clinch the business with a few quick strokes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so; after the manner of Monsieur Lecoq. Well, where do you propose
      to strike your clew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I haven&rsquo;t started in yet. I suppose I shall hit upon one soon
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it. In my opinion you&rsquo;re booked for a sequence of wearisome
      details. The quality you&rsquo;ll require most of, is patience. Besides, if the
      lady should sniff danger, she&rsquo;ll be able to elude you at every turn. You
      want to make it a still hunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am aware of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the first step you mean to take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind. I need time for deliberation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only a single thing to do, and that&rsquo;s not the least Lecoq-like.
      Write to the place where she was last known to be&mdash;Vienna, did you
      say?&mdash;to the consul or postmaster or prefect of police, or better yet
      all three, and ask whither she went when she left there. Then, provided
      you get an answer, write to the next place, and so on down. This will take
      about a hundred years. So, practically, you see, Peixada has supplied you
      with permanent employment. The likelihood that it will ultimately succeed
      is extremely slim. There is danger of a slip-up at every point. However,
      far be it from me to discourage you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of Peixada&rsquo;s plan&mdash;an advertisement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gammon! You don&rsquo;t fancy she would march with open eyes into a palpable
      trap like that, do you? I suspect the matter will end by your making a
      trip to Europe. If Peixada knows what&rsquo;s what, he&rsquo;ll bundle you off next
      week. You could trace her much more effectively in person than by
      letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that be jolly? Only it would involve my neglecting the other
      business that might turn up if I should stick here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it? What other business? What ground have you for believing that
      any other business will turn up? Has the past been so prolific? Besides,
      isn&rsquo;t the summer coming? And isn&rsquo;t the summer a lawyer&rsquo;s dull season? You
      might lose a couple of two-penny district-court cases; but suppose you
      did. See of what advantage it would be to your reputation. Somebody calls
      at your office. &rsquo;Is Mr. Ripley in?&rsquo; &rsquo;No,&rsquo; replies your clerk, &rsquo;Mr. Ripley
      is abroad on important business.&rsquo; &rsquo;Ah,&rsquo; thinks the caller, &rsquo;this Ripley is
      a flourishing young practitioner.&rsquo; And mark my words, nothing hastens
      success like a reputation for success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a picture sends the blood to my head. I mustn&rsquo;t look at it. It would
      make me discontented with the reality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re diplomatic,&rdquo; Hetzel went on, &ldquo;you can get a liberal education
      out of this Peixada case. Just fancy jaunting from town to town in Europe,
      and having your expenses paid. In your moments of leisure you can study
      art and languages and the manners, costumes, and superstitions of the
      hoary east.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all the while, Mrs. Peixada may be living quietly here in New York!
      Isn&rsquo;t it exasperating to realize the difficulty of putting your finger
      upon a given human being, when antecedently it would seem so easy?
      Nevermind; up-hill work though it be, it&rsquo;s sure to get interesting. A
      woman, young, beautiful, totally depraved, a murderess at the age of
      twenty-one&mdash;I wonder what she is like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, probably vulgar to the last degree. Don&rsquo;t form a sentimental
      conception of her. Keep your head cool, or else your imagination will get
      the better of your common sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fear of that. But I shall go at the case with all the more zest,
      because I am anxious to view this novel specimen of womankind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find she&rsquo;s a loud, flashy vixen&mdash;snapping eyes, strident
      voice, bediamonded person. Women who resort to powder and shot to get rid
      of their husbands in this peaceable epoch of divorce, are scarcely worth a
      respectable man&rsquo;s curiosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; cried Arthur, abruptly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that,&rdquo; answered Hetzel, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the corner house&mdash;No. 46.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel spoke metonymically. &ldquo;That&rdquo; was a descending musical scale&mdash;<i>fa,
      mi, re, do, si, la, sol, fa</i>,&mdash;which rang out all at once in a
      clear soprano voice, from someplace near at hand; a wonderfully powerful
      voice, with a superb bugle-like quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Fa, sol, la, si, do, re, mi, fa</i>,&rdquo; continued the songstress. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo; exclaimed Arthur, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s something like.&rdquo; Then for a moment he
      was all ears, and did not speak. At last, &ldquo;The corner house?&rdquo; he queried.
      &ldquo;Has some one moved in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was Hetzel&rsquo;s answer; &ldquo;they moved in yesterday. I had this all the
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This singing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, and a piano to boot. Scales and exercises till I was nearly
      mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this&mdash;this is magnificent. You were to be envied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, it&rsquo;s very fine. But when a man is trying to prepare an
      examination paper in the integral calculus, it distracts and interferes.
      She quite broke up my morning&rsquo;s work.&rdquo; Hetzel was a tutor of mathematics
      in a college not a hundred miles from New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen her?&rdquo; Arthur asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they only took possession yesterday. A singular thing about it is
      that they appear to confine themselves to one floor. The blinds are closed
      every where except in the third story, and last night there was no light
      except in the third story windows. Queer, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur approached the verge of the roof, and looked over at the corner
      house across the street. The third story windows were open wide, and out
      of them proceeded that beautiful soprano voice, now practicing intervals&mdash;<i>fa-si,
      sol-do</i>, and so forth. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he affirmed, &ldquo;this is a regular romance.
      Of course a woman with such a voice is young and beautiful and every thing
      else that&rsquo;s lovely. And then, living cooped up on the third floor of that
      dismal corner house&mdash;she must be in needy circumstances; which adds
      another element of charm and mystery. I suppose she&rsquo;s in training to
      become a prima donna. But who are <i>they?</i> Who lives with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know? I haven&rsquo;t seen any of them. I take it for granted that
      she doesn&rsquo;t live alone, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush-sh!&rdquo; cried Arthur, motioning with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invisible musician had now abandoned her exercises, and was fairly
      launched upon a song, accompanying herself with a piano. Neither Arthur
      nor Hetzel recognized the tune, but they greatly enjoyed listening to it,
      because it was rendered with so much intelligence and delicacy of
      expression. They could not make out the words, either, but from the
      languid, sensuous swing of the melody, it was easy to infer that the theme
      was love. There were several verses; and after each of them, occurred a
      brilliant interlude upon the piano, in which the refrain was caught up and
      repeated with variations. Arthur thought he had never heard sweeter music
      in his life; and very likely he never had. &ldquo;That woman,&rdquo; he declared, when
      silence was restored, &ldquo;that woman, whoever she is, has a <i>soul</i>&mdash;a
      rare enough piece of property in this materialistic age. Such power of
      making music betokens a corresponding power of deep feeling, clear
      thinking, noble acting. I&rsquo;d give my right hand for a glimpse of her. Why
      doesn&rsquo;t some mesmeric influence bring her to the window? Oh, for an
      Asmodeus to unroof her dwelling, and let me peep in at her&mdash;observe
      her, as she sits before her key-board, unconscious of observation!&rdquo; Even
      Hetzel, who was not prone to enthusiasms, who, indeed, derived an expert&rsquo;s
      satisfaction from applying the wet blanket, admitted that she sang &ldquo;like
      an angel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur went on, &ldquo;Opera? Talk about opera? Why, this beats the opera all
      hollow. Can you conceive a more exquisite <i>mise en scene?</i> Twilight!
      Lingering in the west&mdash;over there behind the cathedral&mdash;a pale,
      rosy flush! Above, a star or two, twinkling diamond-like on the breast of
      the coming night! In our faces, the fragrance of the south wind! Below us,
      the darkling river, alive with multitudinous craft! Can your Opera House,
      can your Academy of Music boast any thing equal to it? And then, as the
      flower and perfection of this loveliness, sounding like a clarion from
      heaven, that glorious woman&rsquo;s voice. I tell you, man, it&rsquo;s poetry&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      Rossetti, Alfred de Musset, Heinrich Heine&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;Hello! there
      she goes again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time her selection was the familiar but ever beautiful <i>Erl Konig</i>,
      which she sang with such dramatic spirit that Hetzel himself exclaimed,
      when she had finished, &ldquo;It actually made my heart stand still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Du liebes Kind, komm geh mit mir!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo; hummed Arthur. &ldquo;Ah, how
      persuasively she murmured it! And then, &rsquo;<i>Mein Vater, mein Vater, und
      horest du nicht?&rsquo;.</i>&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it blood-curdling? Didn&rsquo;t it convey the
      entire horror of the situation? the agony of terror that bound the child&rsquo;s
      heart? Beekman Place has had an invaluable acquisition. I&rsquo;ll wager, she&rsquo;s
      as good and as beautiful as St. Cecilia, her patroness. What do you guess,
      is she dark or fair, big or little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The odds are that she&rsquo;s old and ugly. Patti herself, you know, is upwards
      of forty. It isn&rsquo;t probable that with her marvelous musical
      accomplishments, this lady is endowed with youth and beauty also. I
      wouldn&rsquo;t cherish great expectations of her, if I were you; because then,
      if you should ever chance to see her, you&rsquo;ll be so much disappointed.
      Better make up your mind that her attractions begin and end with her
      voice. Complexion? Did you ask my opinion of her complexion? Oh, she&rsquo;s
      blonde&mdash;that goes without saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong again! She&rsquo;s a brunette of the first water; dusky skin, red mouth,
      black, lustrous eyes. You can tell that from the fire she puts into her
      music. As for her age, you&rsquo;re doubly mistaken. If you had the least
      faculty for adding two and two together&mdash;arithmetician that you are&mdash;you&rsquo;d
      know at once that a voice of such freshness, such compass, and such
      volume, could not pertain to a woman far beyond twenty. On the other hand,
      no mere school-girl could sing with such intelligent expression.
      Wherefore, striking an average, I&rsquo;ll venture she&rsquo;s in the immediate
      vicinity of twenty-five. However, conjectures are neither here nor there.
      Where&rsquo;s Josephine? Let&rsquo;s have her up, and interrogate her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this speech, Arthur began to pound his heel upon the roof&mdash;the
      method which these young bachelors employed to make known to their
      domestic that her attendance was wanted. When the venerable Josephine had
      emerged waist-high from the scuttle-door, &ldquo;Josephine,&rdquo; demanded Arthur,
      &ldquo;who is the new tenant of the corner house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Josephine could not tell. Indeed, she was not even aware that the
      corner house had been taken. Arthur set her right on this score, and,
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I wish you would gossip with the divers and sundry
      servants of the neighborhood until you have found out the most you can
      about these new-comers, and then report to me. For this purpose, you are
      allowed an evening&rsquo;s outing. But as you prize my good-will, be both
      diligent and discreet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the twilight deepened into darkness, Arthur remained posted at the
      roof&rsquo;s edge, looking wistfully over toward the third-story windows of the
      corner house. By and by a light flashed up behind them; but the next
      instant an unseen hand drew the shades; and a few moments later the light
      was extinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They retire early,&rdquo; he grumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s getting a little chilly up here?&rdquo; asked
      Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly,&rdquo; he assented, shivering. &ldquo;Shall we go below?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They descended into their sitting-room&mdash;a cozy, book-lined apartment,
      with a permanent savor of tobacco smoke upon its breath&mdash;and chatted
      together till a late hour. The Peixada matter and the mysterious
      songstress of No. 46 pretty equally divided their attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Hetzel&mdash;whose bed-chamber, at the front of the house,
      overlooked the street; whereas Arthur&rsquo;s, at the rear, overlooked the river&mdash;Hetzel
      was awakened by a loud rap at his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh&mdash;er&mdash;what? Who is it?&rdquo; he cried, starting up in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I come in?&rdquo; Arthur&rsquo;s voice demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for a reply, Arthur entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel&rsquo;s wits getting out of tangle, &ldquo;What unheard-of event brings you
      abroad so early?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early? You don&rsquo;t call this early? It&rsquo;s halfpast seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a round half hour earlier than I ever knew you to rise
      before. &rsquo;Is any thing the matter? Are you ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh! I&rsquo;m always up at half-past seven,&rdquo; averred Arthur, with brazen
      indifference to the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the floor, and sent the curtains screeching aloft; having done
      which, he established himself in a rocking-chair, facing the window, and
      rocked to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I&mdash;I understand,&rdquo; said Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The motive that impelled you to rise with the lark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re making much ado about nothing,&rdquo; said Arthur. But he blushed and
      fidgeted uncomfortably. &ldquo;Any body would suppose I was an inveterate
      sluggard. Grant that I <i>am</i> up a little in advance of my usual hour&mdash;is
      that an occasion for so much talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The question is, rather,&rdquo; rejoined Hetzel, with apparent irrelevancy,
      &ldquo;are you rewarded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Arthur tried to appear puzzled; but as his eyes met those of
      his comrade, the corners of his mouth twitched convulsively; and
      thereupon, with a shrug of the shoulders, he laughed outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not ashamed, anyhow,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a good deal for a glimpse of her; and if I can catch one before
      I go down-town, why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Hetzel, sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t be secretive. Let&rsquo;s have the results of your observation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as yet the results are scanty. The household seems to be asleep&mdash;blinds
      down, and every thing as still as a mouse.&mdash;No, there, the blinds are
      raised&mdash;but whoever raises them knows how to keep out of sight. Not
      even a hand comes in view.&mdash;Now, all&rsquo;s quiet again.&mdash;Ah,
      speaking of mice, they have a cat. A black cat sallies forth upon the
      stone ledge outside the window, and performs its ablutions with tongue and
      paw.&mdash;Another! Two cats. This one is of the tiger sort, striped black
      and gray. Isn&rsquo;t it odd&mdash;two cats? What on earth, do you suppose,
      possesses them to keep two cats?&mdash;One of them, the black one, returns
      indoors. Number two whets his claws upon the wood of the window frame&mdash;gazes
      hungrily at the sparrows flitting round about&mdash;yawns&mdash;curls
      himself up&mdash;prepares for a nap there on the stone in the sun.&mdash;Why
      doesn&rsquo;t <i>she</i> come to the window? She ought to want a breath of the
      morning air. This is exasperating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The above monologue had been delivered piecemeal, at intervals of a minute
      or so in duration. At its finish, Hetzel got out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he cried, stretching himself, &ldquo;maintain your vigil, while I go for
      a bath. Perhaps on my return you may have something more salient to
      communicate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when he came back, Arthur said, &ldquo;Not a sign of life since you left,
      except that in response to a summons from within the tiger-cat has
      reentered the house; probably is discussing his breakfast at this moment.
      Hurry up&mdash;dress&mdash;and let us do likewise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the breakfast table, &ldquo;Well, Josephine,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;tell us of the
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Josephine replied that she had subjected all the available maid-servants
      of the block to a pumping process, but that the most she had been able to
      extract from them was&mdash;what her employers already knew. On Thursday,
      the 24th, some person or persons to the deponents unknown, had moved into
      No. 46. But two cart-loads of furniture, besides a piano, had been
      delivered there; and the new occupants appeared to have taken only one
      floor: whence it was generally assumed that they were not people of very
      great consequence. Arthur directed her to keep her eyes and ears open, and
      to inform him from time to time of any further particulars that she might
      glean. This she promised to do. Then he lingered about the front of the
      house till Hetzel began to twit him, demanding sarcastically whether he
      wasn&rsquo;t going downtown at all that morning. &ldquo;Oh, well, I suppose I must,&rdquo;
       he sighed, and reluctantly took himself off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down-town he stopped at the surrogate&rsquo;s office, and verified the
      statements Peixada had made about the administration of his brother&rsquo;s
      estate. Mrs. Peixada had taken the oath to her accounting before the
      United States consul at Vienna, January 11, 1881, Short and Sondheim
      appearing for her here. It was decidedly against the woman&mdash;added, if
      any thing could add, to the blackness of her offense&mdash;the fact that
      she was represented by such disreputable attorneys as Short and Sondheim.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the court house, Arthur proceeded to Peixada&rsquo;s establishment in Reade
      Street near Broadway. He had concluded that the search for Mrs. Peixada
      would have to be very much such an inch by inch process as Hetzel had
      predicted. He could not rid his mind of a feeling that on general
      principles it ought to be no hard task to determine the whereabouts of a
      rich, handsome, and notorious widow: but when he came down to the
      circumstances of this particular case, he had to acknowledge that it was
      an undertaking fraught with difficulties and with uncertainties. He wanted
      to consult his client, and tell him the upshot of his own deliberations.
      The more he considered it, the more persuaded he became that he had better
      cross the ocean and follow in person the trail that Mrs. Peixada had
      doubtless left behind her. Probably the wish fostered the thought. As
      Hetzel had said, he would not run the risk of losing much by his absence.
      A summer in Europe had been the fondest dream of his youth. The very
      occupation of itself, moreover, was inviting. He would be a huntsman&mdash;his
      game, a beautiful woman! And then, to conduct the enterprise by letters
      would not merely consume an eternity of time, but ten chances to one, it
      would end in failure. It did not strike him that this was properly a
      detective&rsquo;s employment, rather than a lawyer&rsquo;s; and even had it done so, I
      don&rsquo;t know that it would have dampened his ardor.&mdash;Meanwhile, he had
      turned into Reade Street, and reached Peixada&rsquo;s place. He was surprised to
      find it closed, until he remembered that to-day was Saturday and that
      Peixada was an orthodox Jew. So he saw nothing for it but to remain
      inactive till Monday. He returned to his office, and spent the remainder
      of the day reading a small, canary-colored volume in the French language&mdash;presumably
      a treatise upon French jurisprudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dined with a couple of professional brethren at a restaurant that
      evening, and did not get home till after dark. Ascending his stoop, he
      stopped to glance over at the corner house. A light shone at the edges of
      the curtains in the third story; but even as he stood there, looking
      toward it, and wishing that by some necromancy his gaze might be empowered
      to penetrate beyond, the light went out. Immediately afterward, however,
      he heard the shades fly clattering upward; and then, all at once, the
      silence was cloven by the same beautiful soprano voice that had interested
      him so much the night before. At first it was very low and soft, a mere
      liquid murmur; but gradually it waxed stronger and more resonant; and
      Arthur recognized the melody as that of Schubert&rsquo;s <i>Wohin</i>. The
      dreamy, plaintive phrases, tremulous with doubt and tense with yearning,
      gushed in a mellow stream from out the darkness. No wonder they set
      Arthur&rsquo;s curiosity on edge. The exquisite quality of the voice, and the
      perfect understanding with which the song was interpreted, were enough to
      prompt a myriad visions of feminine loveliness in any man&rsquo;s brain. That a
      woman could sing in this wise, and yet not be pure and bright and
      beautiful, seemed a self-contradictory proposition. Arthur seated himself
      comfortably upon the broad stone balustrade of his door-step, and made up
      his mind that he would retain that posture until the musical entertainment
      across the way should be concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he soliloquized, &ldquo;why she chooses to sing in the dark. I hope,
      for reasons of sentiment&mdash;because it is in darkness that the effect
      of music is strongest and most subtle. I wonder whether she is alone, or
      whether she is singing to somebody&mdash;perhaps her lover. I wonder&mdash;ah,
      with what precision she caught that high note! How firmly she held it! How
      daintily she executed the cadenza! A woman who can sing like this, how she
      could love! Or rather, how she must have loved already! For such a
      comprehension of passion as her music reveals, could never have come to
      be, except through love. I wonder whether I shall ever know her. Heaven
      help me, if she should turn out, as Hetzel suspects, old and ugly. But
      that&rsquo;s not possible. Whatever the style of her features may be, whatever
      the number of her years, a young and ardent spirit stirs within her. Isn&rsquo;t
      it from the spirit that true beauty springs? I mean by the spirit, the
      capability of inspiring and of experiencing noble emotions. This woman is
      human. Her music proves that. And just in so far as a woman is deeply,
      genuinely human, is she lovely and lovable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this platitudinous vein Arthur went on. Meanwhile the lady had wandered
      away from Schubert&rsquo;s <i>Wohin</i>, and after a brief excursion up and down
      the keyboard, had begun a magically sweet and thrilling melody, which her
      auditor presently identified as Chopin&rsquo;s <i>Berceuse</i>, so arranged that
      the performer could re-enforce certain periods with her voice. He
      listened, captivated, to the supple modulations of the music: and it was
      with a sensation very like a pang of physical pain that suddenly he heard
      it come to an abrupt termination-break sharply off in the middle of a bar,
      as though interrupted by some second person. &ldquo;If it is her lover to whom
      she is singing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame him for stopping her. He could no
      longer hold himself back&mdash;resist the impulse to kiss the lips from
      which such beautiful sounds take wing.&rdquo; Then, immediately, he reproached
      himself for harboring such impertinent fancies. And then he waited on the
      alert, hoping that the music would recommence. But he waited and hoped in
      vain. At last, &ldquo;Well, I suppose there&rsquo;ll be no more to-night,&rdquo; he
      muttered, and turned to enter the house. As he was inserting his latch-key
      into the lock, somebody below on the sidewalk pronounced a hoarse &ldquo;G&rsquo;d
      evening, Mr. Ripley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, good evening, William,&rdquo; returned Arthur, affably, looking down at a
      burly figure at the bottom of the steps.&mdash;William was the
      night-watchman of Beekman Place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say&mdash;by the way&mdash;William&mdash;&rdquo; called Arthur, as the
      watchman was proceeding up the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yassir?&rdquo; queried William, facing about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur ran down the stoop and joined his interlocutor at the foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, William, I see No. 46 has found a tenant. You don&rsquo;t happen to know
      who it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; responded William; &ldquo;moved in Thursday&mdash;old party of the name
      of Hart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old party? Indeed! Then I suppose he has a daughter&mdash;eh? It was the
      daughter who was singing a little while ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno if she&rsquo;s got a darter. Party&rsquo;s a woman. I hain&rsquo;t seen no darter.
      Mebbe it was the lady herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; that&rsquo;s not possible.&mdash;Hart, do you say the name is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. G. Hart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does G. stand for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno. Might be John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is <i>Mr</i>. G. Hart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess there ain&rsquo;t none. Folks say she&rsquo;s a I widder.&mdash;Well, Wiggins
      ought to thank his stars to have that house taken at last. It&rsquo;s going on
      four years now, it&rsquo;s lain there empty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mused Arthur, absently, &ldquo;An old lady named Hart; and he doesn&rsquo;t know
      whether the musician is her daughter or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fact is,&rdquo; put in William, &ldquo;I dunno much about &rsquo;em&mdash;only what I&rsquo;ve
      heerd. But we&rsquo;ll know all about them before long. Every body knows every
      body in this neighborhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so.&mdash;Well, good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, sir,&rdquo; said William, touching his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upstairs in the sitting-room, Arthur threw himself upon a sofa. Hetzel was
      away. By and by Arthur picked up a book from the table, and tried to read.
      He made no great headway, however: indeed, an hour elapsed, and he had not
      yet turned the page. His thoughts were busy with the fair one of the
      corner house. He had spun out quite a history for her before he had done.
      He devoutly trusted that ere long Fate would arrange a meeting between her
      and himself. He whistled over the melody of <i>Wohin</i>, imitating as
      nearly as he could the manner in which she had sung it. When his mind
      reverted to the Peixada business, as it did presently, lo! the prospective
      trip to Europe had lost half its charm. He felt that there was plenty to
      keep one interested here in New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day Sunday, despite the fun at his expense in which Hetzel liberally
      indulged, Arthur haunted the front of the house. But when he went to bed
      Sunday night, he was no wiser respecting his musical neighbor than he had
      been four-and-twenty hours before.

      CHAPTER III.&mdash;STATISTICAL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ONDAY morning
      Arthur entered Peixada&rsquo;s warehouse promptly as the clock struck ten.
      Peixada had not yet got down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur was conducted by a dapper little salesman to an inclosure fenced
      off at the rear of the showroom, and bidden to &ldquo;make himself at home.&rdquo; By
      and by, to kill time, he picked up a directory&mdash;the only literature
      in sight&mdash;and extracted what amusement he could from it, by hunting
      out the names of famous people&mdash;statesmen, financiers, etc. The
      celebrities exhausted, he turned to his own name and to those of his
      friends. Among others, he looked for Hart. Of Harts there were a
      multitude, but of G. Harts only three&mdash;a Gustav, a Gerson, and a
      George. George was written down a laborer, Gerson a peddler, Gustav a
      barber; none, it was obvious, could be the G. Hart of Beekman Place. In
      about half an hour Peixada arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, good morning,&rdquo; he said briskly. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to bother you so soon again, Mr. Peixada,&rdquo; said Arthur,
      stiffly; &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Peixada interrupted. &ldquo;Glad to see you. Sit down.
      Smoke a cigar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; pursued Arthur, his cigar afire, &ldquo;having thought the matter well
      over&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have concluded&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That your view of the case was correct&mdash;that we&rsquo;re in for a long,
      expensive, and delicate piece of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a doubt of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, beforehand it would strike one as the simplest thing in the
      world to locate a woman like your sister-in-law. But this case is
      peculiar. It&rsquo;s going on four years that nobody has heard from her. Clear
      back in January, 1881, she was somewhere in Vienna. But since then she&rsquo;s
      had the leisure to travel around the world a dozen times. She may be in
      Australia, California, Brazil&mdash;or not a mile away from us, here in
      New York. She may have changed her name. She may have married again. She
      may have died.&mdash;The point I&rsquo;m driving at is that you mustn&rsquo;t
      attribute it to a lack of diligence on my part, if we shouldn&rsquo;t obtain any
      satisfactory results for a long while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly not, certainly not,&rdquo; protested Peixada, making the words
      very large, and waving his hand deprecatingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a man of common sense,
      a business man. I don&rsquo;t need to be told that it&rsquo;s going to be slow work. I
      knew that. Otherwise I shouldn&rsquo;t have hired you. I could have managed it
      by myself, except that I hadn&rsquo;t the time to spare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Arthur, undismayed by Peixada&rsquo;s frankness, &ldquo;my idea of
      the tactics to be pursued is to begin with Vienna, January, &rsquo;81, and
      proceed inch by inch down to the present time. There are two methods of
      doing this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which are&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One is to enlist the services of the United States consuls. I can write
      to Vienna, to our consul, and ask him to find out where Mrs. Peixada went
      when she left there; then <i>to</i> the consul at the next place&mdash;and
      so on to the end. But this method is cumbrous and uncertain. The trail is
      liable to be lost at any point. At the best, it would take a long, long
      time. Besides, the consuls would expect a large remuneration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the other method?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I propose it reluctantly. It is one which, so far as my personal
      inclinations are concerned, I should prefer not to take. I&mdash;I might
      myself go to Vienna and conduct the investigation on the spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; reflected Peixada.&mdash;After a pause, &ldquo;That would be still more
      expensive,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure.&mdash;It seems to me that there is a third method which you haven&rsquo;t
      thought of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not engage the services of an attorney in Vienna, instead of the
      consul&rsquo;s? You can easily get the name of some reliable attorney there.
      Then write on, stating the case, and offering a sum in consideration of
      which he is to furnish us with the information we want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I might do that,&rdquo; Arthur answered, with a mortifying sense that
      Peixada&rsquo;s plan was at once more practical and more promising than either
      of those which he had proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better try it, anyhow,&rdquo; his client went on. &ldquo;Attorney&rsquo;s fees, as I chance
      to know, are low in Austria. Fifty dollars ought to be ample for a
      starter. I&rsquo;ll give you a check for that amount now. You can exchange it
      for a draft, after you&rsquo;ve decided on your man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peixada filled out a check. Arthur took up his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, àpropos,&rdquo; said Peixada, without explaining what it was àpropos of, &ldquo;I
      showed you some newspaper clippings about Mrs. P.&rsquo;. trial the other day&mdash;recollect?
      Well, I&rsquo;ve got a scrapbook full of them in my safe. Suppose you&rsquo;d find it
      useful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It could do no harm for me to run it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peixada touched a bell, gave the requisite orders to the underling who
      responded, and said to Arthur, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll fetch it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently the man returned, bearing a large, square volume, bound in
      bluish black leather. Arthur bowed himself out, with the volume under his
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of the day he passed in procuring the name of a trustworthy
      Viennese attorney, drafting a letter to him in English, and having it
      translated into German. The attorney&rsquo;s name was Ulrich. Arthur inclosed
      the amount of Peixada&rsquo;s check in the form of an order upon an
      Americo-Austrian banking house. At last, weary, and with his zeal in
      Peixada&rsquo;s cause somewhat abated, he went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the evening he dropped into a concert garden on
      Fifty-eighth Street. He had not been seated there a great while before
      somebody greeted him with a familiar tap upon the shoulder and an easy
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; Looking up, he saw Mr. Rimo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Arthur, offering his hand, &ldquo;how do you do? Sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rimo had an odoriferous jonquil in his buttonhole, and carried a
      silver-headed Malacca cane. He drew up to the table, lit a cigar with a
      wax match, and called for Vichy water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Ripley,&rdquo; he questioned solicitously, &ldquo;how are <i>you</i>
      getting on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well, thanks. I saw your uncle this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so? Any news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean about the case? Nothing decisive as yet. It&rsquo;s hardly time to
      expect anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; of course not. I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing. You&rsquo;ve got a nice job
      before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and an odd one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I was thinking of especially was the lady. She&rsquo;s a specimen. Not
      many like her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to be hoped not. You of course knew her very well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t say as I did. I can&rsquo;t say as I <i>knew</i> her very well. She
      wasn&rsquo;t an easy woman to know. But I&rsquo;d seen a great deal of her. It was a
      mere chance that I didn&rsquo;t marry her myself. Lucky, wasn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was this way. You see, one evening while she was still Miss
      Karon, I called on her. Who should sail in five minutes later but Uncle
      Barney? She was right up to the top notch that evening&mdash;devilish
      handsome, with her black eyes and high color, and as sharp as an IXL
      blade. When we left&mdash;we left together, the old man and I&mdash;when
      we left, I was saying to myself, &rsquo;By gad, I couldn&rsquo;t do better. I&rsquo;ll
      propose for her to-morrow.&rsquo; Just then he pipes up. &rsquo;What is your opinion
      of that young lady?&rsquo; he asks. &rsquo;My opinion?&rsquo; says I. &rsquo;My opinion is that
      she&rsquo;s a mighty fine gal.&rsquo; &rsquo;Well, you bet she is,&rsquo; says he; &rsquo;and I&rsquo;m glad
      you think so, because she&rsquo;s apt to be your auntie before a great while.&rsquo;
      &rsquo;The devil!&rsquo; says I. &rsquo;Yes, sir, says he. &rsquo;I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to marry
      her. I&rsquo;m going to speak to her father about it in the morning.&rsquo; Well, of
      course that settled my hash. I wasn&rsquo;t going to gamble against my uncle.
      Narrow escape, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having concluded this picturesque narrative, Mr. Rimo emptied a bumper of
      sparkling Vichy water, with the remark, &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s <i>to</i> you,&rdquo; and
      applied a second wax match to his cigar, which had gone out while he was
      speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who were her people?&rdquo; asked Arthur. &ldquo;What sort of a family did she come
      from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, her family was correct enough. Name was Karon, as you know already.
      Her old man was a watch-maker by trade, and kept a shop on Second Avenue.
      I guess he did a pretty comfortable business till he got struck on
      electricity. He invented some sort of an electric clock, and sent it to
      the Centennial at Philadelphia. It took the cake; and after that Michael
      Karon was a ruined man. Why? Because after that he neglected his business,
      and spent all his time and all the money he had saved, in fooling around
      and trying to improve what the Centennial judges had thought was good
      enough. He couldn&rsquo;t let well alone. Result was he spoiled the clock, and
      went all to pieces. He was in a desperate bad way when Uncle Barney
      stepped up and married his daughter. Hang a man who&rsquo;s got an itch for
      improvement. What I say is, lay on to a good thing, and then stick to it
      for all you&rsquo;re worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He died shortly after the marriage, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;handed in his checks that fall. She had had a tip-top
      education; used to give lessons in music, and this, that, and the other
      &rsquo;ology. She was the most knowing creature I ever saw&mdash;had no end of
      <i>chochmah</i>. Don&rsquo;t know what <i>chochmah</i> is? Well, that means
      Jewish shrewdness; and she held a corner in it, too. But such a temper!
      Lord, when she got excited, her eyes were terrible. I can just imagine her
      downing the old man. I&rsquo;ll never forget the way she looked at me one time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there ain&rsquo;t much to tell&mdash;only this. Of course, you know, it&rsquo;s
      the fashion to kiss the bride at her wedding. But I happened to be on the
      road at the date of their wedding, and couldn&rsquo;t get back in time. I didn&rsquo;t
      mean to lose that kiss, just the same. So when I called on them, after my
      return, &rsquo;Aunt Judith,&rsquo; says I, &rsquo;when are you going to liquidate that
      little debt you owe me?&rsquo; &rsquo;Owe you?&rsquo; says she, looking surprised. &rsquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      know I owed you any thing.&rsquo; &rsquo;Why, certainly,&rsquo; says I; &rsquo;you owe me a kiss:&rsquo;
      She laughed and shied off and tried to change the subject. &rsquo;Come,&rsquo; says I,
      &rsquo;stepup to the captain&rsquo;s office and settle.&rsquo; &rsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says Uncle Barney,
      &rsquo;kiss your nephew, Judith.&rsquo; &rsquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to kiss him,&rsquo; says she,
      beginning to look dark. &rsquo;You kiss him,&rsquo; says Uncle Barney, looking darker.
      And she&mdash;she kissed me. But, gad, the way she glared! Her eyes were
      just swimming in fire. I swear, it frightened me; and I&rsquo;m pretty tough. I
      don&rsquo;t want any more kisses of that sort, thank you. It stung my lips like
      a hornet.&rdquo; Mr. Rimo drew a deep breath, and caressed the knob of his cane
      with the apple of his chin. &ldquo;It was an awful moment,&rdquo; as they say on the
      stage, he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that&mdash;what was his name?&mdash;the second of her victims,&rdquo;
       inquired Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bolen&mdash;Edward Bolen. He was Uncle Barney&rsquo;s coachman. After the
      old boy got married and retired from business, he set up a team, and
      undertook to be aristocratic. The theory was that when he and she began
      rowing that night, Bolen attempted to step in between them, and that she
      just reminded him of his proper place with an ounce of lead. She never was
      tried for his murder. I suppose her acquittal in the case of Uncle Barney
      made the authorities think it wouldn&rsquo;t pay to try her again. Every body
      said it was an infernal outrage for her to go free; but between you and me&mdash;and
      mum&rsquo;s the word&mdash;I was real glad of it. Not that she hadn&rsquo;t ought to
      have been punished for shooting her husband. But to have locked up her
      confoundedly pretty face out of sight in a prison&mdash;that would have
      been an infernal outrage, and no mistake. As for hanging her, they&rsquo;d never
      have hanged her, anyhow&mdash;not even if the jury had convicted. But I
      don&rsquo;t mean to say that she was innocent. Sane? Well, you never saw a saner
      woman. She knew what she was about better than you and I do now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you account for the murder? What motive do you assign?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most everybody said &rsquo;money&rsquo;&mdash;claimed that she went deliberately to
      work and killed the old man for his money. Some few thought there must be
      another man at the bottom of it&mdash;that she had a paramour who put her
      up to it. But they didn&rsquo;t know her. She had a hot temper; but as far as
      men were concerned, she was as cool as a Roman punch. My own notion is
      that she did it in a fit of passion. He irritated her somehow, and she got
      mad, and let fire. You see, I recollect the way she glared at me that
      time. Savage was no word for it. If she&rsquo;d had a gun in her hand, my life
      wouldn&rsquo;t have been worth that&rdquo;&mdash;and Mr. Rimo snapped his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say, you have contrived to interest me in her. I shall be glad
      when I have an opportunity of seeing her with my own eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you take my advice. When you&rsquo;ve found out her whereabouts, don&rsquo;t go
      too close, as they tell the boys at the menagerie. She&rsquo;s as vicious as
      they make them, I don&rsquo;t deny it. But she&rsquo;s got a wonderful fascination
      about her, notwithstanding, and if she thought it worth her while, she
      could wind you around her finger like a hair, and never know she&rsquo;d done
      it. I wish you the best possible luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rimo rose, shook hands, moved off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur&rsquo;s dreams that night were haunted by a wild, fierce, Medusa-like
      woman&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his office, next morning, the first object that caught his eye was the
      black, leather-bound scrapbook that Peixada had given him yesterday. It
      lay where he had left it, on his desk. Beginning by listlessly turning the
      pages, he gradually became interested in their contents. I shall have to
      beg the reader&rsquo;s attention to an abstract of Mrs. Peix-ada&rsquo;s trial, before
      my story can be completed; and I may as well do so now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prosecution set out logically by establishing the fact of death. A
      surgeon testified to all that was essential in this regard. The second
      witness was one &rsquo;Patrick Martin. I copy his testimony word for word from
      the columns of the <i>New York Daily Gazette.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Martin,&rdquo; began the district-attorney, &ldquo;what is your business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a merchant, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the commodities in which you deal are?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ales, wines, and liquors, your honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At retail or wholesale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both, sir; but mostly retail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your store situated, Mr. Martin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the southwest corner of Eighty-fifth Street and Ninth Avenue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the residence of the deceased, Mr. Bernard Peixada, near to your
      place of business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was, sir&mdash;on the next block.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What block? How is the block bounded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The block, sir, is bounded by Eighty-fifth and Eighty-sixth Streets, and
      Ninth and Tenth Avenues, your honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many houses on that block?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, your honor; only the house of the deceased. That stands on the top
      of a hill, back from the street, with big grounds around it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had Mr. Peixada lived there long?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since the 1st of May, this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Martin, do you remember the night of July 30th?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, I do, sir; and I&rsquo;ll not soon forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. Will you, then, as clearly and as fully as you can, tell the court
      and jury all the circumstances that combine to fix the night of July 30th
      in your memory? Take your time, speak up loudly, and look straight at the
      twelfth juryman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, on that night, toward two o&rsquo;clock the next morning&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (Laughter among the auditors; speedily repressed by the court attendants.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be disconcerted, Mr. Martin. On the morning of July 31st?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same, sir. On that morning, at about two o&rsquo;clock, I was outside in
      the street, putting the shutters over the windows of my store. While I was
      doing it, your honor, it seemed to me that I heard a noise&mdash;very weak
      and far away&mdash;like as if some one&mdash;a woman, or it might be a
      child&mdash;was crying out. I stopped for a moment, sir, and listened.
      Sure enough, I heard a voice&mdash;so faint you&rsquo;d never have known it from
      the wind, except by sharpening your ears&mdash;I heard a voice, coming
      down the hill from the Jew&rsquo;s house over the way. I couldn&rsquo;t make out no
      words, but it was that thin and screechy that, &rsquo;Certain,&rsquo; says I to
      myself, &rsquo;that old felley there is up to some mischief, or my name&rsquo;s not
      Patsy Martin.&rsquo; Well, after I had got done with the shutters, I went into
      the house by the family entrance, and says I to my wife, &rsquo;There&rsquo;s a woman
      yelling in the house on the hill,&rsquo; says I. &rsquo;What of that?&rsquo; says she.
      &rsquo;Maybe I&rsquo;d better go up,&rsquo; says I. &rsquo;You&rsquo;d better be after coming to bed and
      minding your business,&rsquo; says she. &rsquo;It&rsquo;s most likely a way them heathen
      have of amusing themselves,&rsquo; says she. But, &rsquo;No,&rsquo; says I. &rsquo;Some one&rsquo;s in
      distress,&rsquo; says I; &rsquo;and I guess the best thing I can do will be to light a
      lantern and go along up,&rsquo; says I. So my wife, your honor, she lights the
      lantern for me, and, &rsquo;Damminus take &rsquo;em,&rsquo; says she, to wish me good luck;
      and off I started, across the street, through the gate, and up the
      wagon-road that leads to Peixada&rsquo;s house. Meanwhile, your honor, the
      screaming had stopped. Never a whisper more did I hear; and thinks I to
      myself, &rsquo;It was only my imagination,&rsquo; thinks I&mdash;when whist! All of a
      sudden, not two feet away from me, there in the road, a voice calls out
      &rsquo;Help, help.&rsquo; The devil take me, I thought I&rsquo;d jump out of my skin for
      fright, it came so unexpected. But I raised my lantern all the same, and
      cast a look around; and there before me on the ground, I seen an object
      which, as true as gospel, I took to be a ghost until I recognized it for
      Mrs. Peixada&mdash;the lady that&rsquo;s sitting behind you, sir&mdash;the Jew&rsquo;s
      wife, herself. There she lay, kneeling in front of me and when she seen
      who I was, &rsquo;Help, for God&rsquo;s sake, help,&rsquo; says she, for all the world like
      a Christian. I knew right away that something wrong had happened, from her
      scared face and big, staring eyes; and besides, her bare feet and the
      white rag she wore in the place of a decent dress&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point considerable sensation was created among the audience by the
      prosecuting attorney, who, interrupting the witness and addressing the
      court, remarked, &ldquo;Your honor will observe that the prisoner has covered
      her face with a veil. This is a piece of theatricalism against which I
      must emphatically protest. It is, moreover, the jury&rsquo;s prerogative to
      watch the prisoner&rsquo;s physiognomy, as the story of her crime is told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Recorder Hewitt ordered the prisoner to remove her veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Mr. Martin,&rdquo; said the prosecutor to the witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, as I was saying, there I seen Mrs. Peix-ada, half crouching
      and half sitting there in the road. And when I got over the start she gave
      me, &rsquo;Excuse me, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; says I, &rsquo;but didn&rsquo;t I hear you hollering out for
      help?&rsquo; &rsquo;Faith, you did,&rsquo; says she. &rsquo;Well, here I am, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; says I; &rsquo;and
      now, will you be kind enough to inform me what&rsquo;s the trouble?&rsquo; says I.
      &rsquo;The trouble?&rsquo; says she. &rsquo;The trouble is that there&rsquo;s two men kilt up at
      the house, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the trouble,&rsquo; says she. &rsquo;Kilt?&rsquo; says I. &rsquo;Yes,
      shot,&rsquo; says she. &rsquo;And who shot them?&rsquo; says I. &rsquo;Myself,&rsquo; says she. &rsquo;Mother
      o&rsquo; God!&rsquo; says I. &rsquo;Well,&rsquo; says she, &rsquo;wont you be after going up to the
      house and trying to help the poor wretches?&rsquo; says she. &rsquo;I don&rsquo;t know but I
      will,&rsquo; says I. And on up the road to the house I went. The front door,
      your honor, was open wide, and the gas blazing at full head within. I ran
      up the steps and through the vestibil, and there in the hall I seen that
      what Mrs. Peixada had said was the truest word she ever spoke in her life.
      Old Peixada, he lay there on one side, as dead as sour beer, with blood
      all around him; and on the other side lay Mr. Bolen&mdash;whom I knew
      well, for he was a good customer of my own, your honor&mdash;more dead
      than the Jew, if one might say so. I, sir, I just remained long enough to
      cross myself and whisper, &rsquo;God have mercy on them and then off I went to
      call an officer. On the way down the hill, I passed Mrs. Peixada again;
      and this time she was laying out stiff in the road, with her eyes closed
      and her mouth open, like she was in a fit. She had nothing on but that
      white gown I spoke of before; and very elegant she looked, your honor,
      flat there, like a corpse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the district-attorney stopped the witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I must again direct your attention to the
      irregular conduct of the prisoner. She has now turned her back to the
      jury, and covered her face with her hands. This is merely a method of
      evading the injunction which your honor saw fit to impose upon her with
      respect to her veil. I must insist upon her displaying her full face to
      the jury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sondheim, of counsel for the defendant: &ldquo;If the Court please, it
      strikes me that my learned brother is really a trifle too exacting. I can
      certainly see no objection to my client&rsquo;s holding her hands to her face.
      Considering the painfulness of her situation, it is no more than natural
      that she should desire to shield her face. I must beg the Court to
      remember that this prisoner is no ordinary criminal, but a lady of refined
      and sensitive instincts. A little indulgence, it seems to me, is due to
      her on account of her sex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The district-attorney: &ldquo;The prisoner had better understand once for all
      that her sex isn&rsquo;t going to protect her in this prosecution. The law is no
      respecter of sex. As for her refined and sensitive instincts, if she has
      any, I advise her to put them into her pocket. This jury has too much good
      sense to be affected by any exhibition that she may make for their
      benefit. I submit the matter to the Court&rsquo;s good judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The recorder: &ldquo;Madam, you will turn your chair toward the jury, and keep
      your face uncovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The district-attorney: &ldquo;Well, Mr. Martin, what next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The witness: &ldquo;Weil, sir, I hurried along down as fast as ever I could, and
      stopped at my own place just long enough to tell my wife what had
      happened, and to send her up to Mrs. Peixada with a bottle of spirits to
      bring her around. Then I went to the station-house, and informed the
      gentleman at the desk of the state of affairs. Him and a couple of
      officers came back with me; and they, your honor, took charge of the
      premises, and&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all I know about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martin was not cross-examined. Police Sergeant Riley, succeeding him, gave
      an account of the prisoner&rsquo;s arrest and of her subsequent demeanor at the
      station-house. &ldquo;The lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;appeared to be unable to walk&mdash;leastwise,
      she limped all the way with great difficulty. We thought she was shamming,
      and treated her accordingly. But afterwards it turned out that she had a
      sprained ankle.&rdquo; She had answered the formal questions&mdash;name? age?
      residence?&mdash;in full; and to the inquiry whether she desired to make
      any statement or remark relative to the charge preferred against her, had
      replied, &ldquo;Nothing, except that I shot them both&mdash;Bernard Peixada and
      Edward Bolen.&rdquo; They had locked her up in the captain&rsquo;s private room for
      the rest of the night; and the following morning she had been transferred
      to the Tombs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next witness was Miss Ann Doyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Doyle, what is your occupation?&rdquo; asked the district-attorney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a cook, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a situation, at present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you been idle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since the 31st of July, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prior to that date where were you employed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the family of Mr. Peixada, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you present at Mr. Peixada&rsquo;s house on the night of July 30th?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us, please, how you came to be absent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, just after dinner, along about seven o&rsquo;clock, Mrs. Peixada,
      who was laying abed with a sore foot, she called me to her, sir, and,
      &rsquo;Ann,&rsquo; says she, &rsquo;you can have the evening out, and you needn&rsquo;t come home
      till to-morrow morning,&rsquo; sir, says she.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you availed yourself of this privilege?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, I did, sir. I came home the next morning, sir, in time to get
      breakfast, having passed the night at my sister&rsquo;s; and when I got there,
      sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about that, Miss Doyle. Now, tell us, was it a customary thing
      for Mrs. Peixada to let you go away for the entire night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never did it before, sir. Of course I had my regular Thursday and
      Sunday, but I was always expected to be in the house by ten o&rsquo;clock, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, Miss Doyle. Miss Katharine Mahoney, take the stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mahoney described herself as an &ldquo;upstairs girl,&rdquo; and said that she,
      too, until the date of the murder, had been employed in Mr. Peixada&rsquo;s
      household. To her also, on the evening of July 30th, Mrs. Peixada had
      accorded leave of absence for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that,&rdquo; reasoned the district-attorney, &ldquo;all the servants were away, by
      the prisoner&rsquo;s prearrangement, at the hour of the perpetration of the
      crime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; since me and Ann were the only servants they kept. Mr. Bolen
      staid behind, to his sorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the case of each of these witnesses, the prisoner&rsquo;s counsel waived
      cross-examination, saying, &ldquo;If the court please, we shall not take issue
      on the allegations of fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prosecution rested, reserving, however, the right to call witnesses in
      rebuttal, if need should be. The defense started with a physician, Dr.
      Leopold Jetz, of Lexington Avenue, near Fifty-ninth Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Jetz, how long have you known Mrs. Peix-ada, the prisoner at the
      bar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever since she was born. I helped to bring her into the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you last attend her professionally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I paid her my last professional visit on the 1st of August, 1878; eight
      days before she was married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was her trouble at that time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General depression of the nervous system. To speak technically, cerebral
      anemia, or insufficient nourishment of the brain, complicated by sacral
      neuralgia&mdash;neuralgia at the base of the spine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were these ailments of long standing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was called in on the 29th of May. I treated her consecutively till
      August 1st. That would make two months. But she had been suffering for
      some time before I was summoned. The troubles had crept upon her
      gradually. On the 8th of August she was married. She had just completed
      her nineteenth year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, doctor, was the condition of Mrs. Peixada&rsquo;s health, at the time your
      treatment was discontinued, such as to predispose her to insanity?&rdquo;
       (Question objected to, on the ground that the witness had not been
      produced as an expert, and that his competence to give expert testimony
      was not established. Objection overruled.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my opinion,&rdquo; said Dr. Jetz, &ldquo;at the time I last saw her
      professionally, Mrs. Peixada was in an exceedingly critical condition.
      Although evincing no symptoms of insanity proper, her brain was highly
      irritated, and her whole nervous system deranged; so that an additional
      strain of any kind put upon her, might easily have precipitated acute
      mania. I told her father that she was in no wise fit to get married; but
      he chose to disregard my advice. I think I may answer your question
      affirmatively, and say that her health was such as to predispose her to
      insanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the district attorney: &ldquo;Doctor, are your sentiments&mdash;your personal
      sentiments&mdash;for the prisoner of a friendly or an unfriendly nature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly, sir, of a friendly nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would be sorry to see her hanged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor replied by a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or sent to State Prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not bear to think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would do your utmost&mdash;would you not?&mdash;to save her from such
      a fate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eagerly, sir, eagerly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s sufficient, doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An alienist of some distinction followed Dr. Jetz. He said that he had
      listened attentively to the evidence so far adduced in court, had read the
      depositions taken before the magistrate and the coroner, had conferred at
      length with the preceding witness, and finally had made a diagnosis of
      Mrs. Peixada&rsquo;s case in her cell at the Tombs. He believed that, though
      perfectly sane and responsible at present, she had &ldquo;within a brief period
      suffered from a disturbance of cerebral function.&rdquo; There were &ldquo;indications
      which led him to infer that at the time of the homicide she was
      organically a lunatic.&rdquo; The district-attorney took him in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, are you the author of a work entitled, &rsquo;Pathology of Mind
      Popularly Expounded&rsquo;&mdash;published, as I see by the title page, in
      1873?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, sir, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that book express with tolerable accuracy your views on the subject
      of insanity?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does&mdash;certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Now, doctor, I will read aloud from Chapter III., page 75. Be
      good enough to follow.&mdash;&rsquo;It is then a fact that there exists a
      borderland between pronounced dementia, or mania, and sound mental health,
      in which it is impossible to apply the terms, sane and insane, with any
      approach to scientific nicety. Nor is it to be disputed that a person may
      have entered this borderland may have departed from the realm of
      unimpaired intelligence, and not yet have attained the pandemonium of
      complete madness&mdash;and withal, retain the faculty of distinguishing
      between right and wrong, together with the control of will necessary to
      the selection and employment of either. This borderland is a sort of
      twilight region in which, though blurred in outline, objects have not
      become invisible. Crimes committed by subject? in the state thus
      described, can not philosophically be extenuated on the ground of mental
      aberration.&rsquo;&mdash;I suppose, doctor, you acknowledge the authorship of
      this passage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And subscribe to its correctness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It expresses the opinion which prevails among the authorities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well and good. Now, to return to the case at bar, are you willing to
      swear that on the night of July 30th, the &rsquo;disturbance of cerebral
      function&rsquo; which, you have told us, Mrs. Peixada was perhaps suffering from&mdash;are
      you willing to swear that it had progressed beyond this borderland which
      you have so clearly elucidated in your book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not willing to swear positively. It is my opinion that it had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not willing to swear positively. Then, you are not willing to
      swear positively, I take it, that Mrs. Peixada&rsquo;s crime did not belong to
      that category which &rsquo;can not philosophically be extenuated on the ground
      of mental aberration?&rsquo;.rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not positively&mdash;no, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is your opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How firm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very firm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So firm, doctor, that if you were on this jury, you would feel bound,
      under any and all circumstances, to acquit the prisoner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So firm that I should feel bound to acquit her, unless evidence of a
      highly damaging character was forthcoming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, suppose that evidence of a highly damaging character was
      forthcoming, would you convict?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, doctor. You can go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having thus sought to prove the prisoner&rsquo;s irresponsibility, the defense
      endeavored to establish her fair name. Half-a-dozen ladies and two or
      three gentleman attested that they had known her for many years, and had
      always found her to be of a peculiarly sweet and gentle temperament. Not
      one of them would believe her capable of an act of violence, unless, at
      the time of committing it, she was out of her right mind. As the last of
      these persons left the stand, Mr. Sondheim said, &ldquo;Your honor, our case is
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a pretty lame case it is,&rdquo; commented the district-attorney. &ldquo;I beg
      leave to remind the court that it is Friday, and to move for an
      adjournment until Monday, in order that the People may have an opportunity
      to produce witnesses in rebuttal.&rdquo; The motion was granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday a second alienist, one whose renown quite equaled that of the
      first, declared it as his opinion, based upon a personal examination of
      the accused, that she was not and never had been in the slightest degree
      insane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Dr. Julius Gunther in court?&rdquo; called out the district-attorney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Gunther elbowed his way to the front, and was sworn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Gunther,&rdquo; the prosecutor inquired, &ldquo;you are a physician in general
      practice&mdash;yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were also, I believe, up to the time of his death, physician to the
      family of Mr. Bernard Peixada?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor nodded affirmatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever attend the decedent&rsquo;s wife&mdash;Mrs. Peixada&mdash;this
      woman here&mdash;the prisoner at the bar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the 20th of July last I began to treat her for a sprained ankle. I
      called on her every day or two, up to the 30th.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were treating her for a sprained ankle. Did you make any observation
      of her general health?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you found it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about her mental faculties? Any symptoms of derangement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one. I have seldom known a smarter woman. She had an exceptionally
      well-balanced mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do, doctor,&rdquo; said the district-attorney. To the other side, &ldquo;Want
      to cross-examine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is a well-balanced mind, doctor,&rdquo; asked Mr. Sondheim, &ldquo;proof positive of
      sanity? Is it not possible for one to be perfectly rational on ordinary
      topics, and yet liable to attacks of mama when irritated by some special
      circumstances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, speaking broadly, I suppose so. But in this particular instance, no.
      That woman is no more crazy than you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the prosecutor, &ldquo;now, as to my lady&rsquo;s alleged good character?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A score of witnesses proceeded to demolish it. Miss Emily Millard had
      acted as music teacher to the prisoner when she was a little girl. Miss
      Millard related a dozen anecdotes illustrative of the prisoner&rsquo;s
      ungovernable temper. Misses Sophie Dedold, Florentine Worch, and Esther
      Steinbaum had gone to school with the prisoner. If their accounts were to
      be believed, she was a &ldquo;flirt,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;doubleface.&rdquo; At length, Mrs. George
      Washington Shapiro took the stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Shapiro, were you acquainted with Mr. Bernard Peixada, the
      decedent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well acquainted with him&mdash;an old friend of his family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with his wife, the prisoner?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made her acquaintance shortly before Mr. Peixada married her. After
      that I saw her as often as once a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please give us your estimate of her character?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad, very bad. She is false, she is treacherous, but above all, she is
      spiteful and ill-humored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For example?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I could give twenty examples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give one, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, one day I called upon her and found her in tears. &rsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said
      I, &rsquo;what are you crying about?&rsquo; &rsquo;Oh,&rsquo; she answered, &rsquo;I wish Bernard
      Peixada&rsquo;&mdash;she always spoke of her husband as Bernard Peixada&mdash;&rsquo;I
      wish Bernard Peixada was dead.&rsquo; &rsquo;What!&rsquo; I remonstrated. &rsquo;You wish your
      husband was dead? You ought not to say such a thing. What can you mean?&rsquo;
      &rsquo;I mean that I hate him,&rsquo; she replied. &rsquo;But if you hate him,&rsquo; said I, &rsquo;if
      you are unhappy with him, why don&rsquo;t you wish that you yourself were dead,
      instead of wishing it of him?&rsquo; &rsquo;Oh,&rsquo; she explained, &rsquo;I am young. I have
      much to live for. He is an old, bad man. It would a good thing all around,
      if he were dead.&rsquo;.rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you give us the date of this extraordinary conversation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was some time, I think, in last June; a little more than a month
      before she murdered him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The efforts of the prisoner&rsquo;s counsel to break down Mrs. Shapiro&rsquo;s
      testimony were unavailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Short,&rdquo; says the <i>Gazette</i>, &ldquo;now summed up in his most effective
      style, dwelling at length upon the prisoner&rsquo;s youth and previous good
      character, and arguing that she could never have committed the crime in
      question, except under the sway of an uncontrollable impulse induced by
      mental disease. He wept copiously, and succeeded in bringing tears to the
      eyes of several jurymen. He was followed by Assistant-district-attorney
      Sardick, for the People, who carefully analyzed the evidence, and showed
      that it placed the guilt of the accused beyond the reach of a reasonable
      doubt. Recorder Hewitt charged dead against the fair defendant, consuming
      an hour and a quarter. The jury thereupon retired; but at the expiration
      of seventeen minutes they returned to the court-room, and, much to the
      surprise of every one present, announced that they had agreed upon a
      verdict. The prisoner was directed to stand up. She was deathly pale; her
      teeth chattered; her hands clutched at the railing in front of the clerk&rsquo;s
      desk. The formal questions were put in their due order and with becoming
      solemnity. A profound sensation was created among the spectators when the
      foreman pronounced the two decisive words, &rsquo;Not guilty.&rsquo; A vivid crimson
      suffused the prisoner&rsquo;s throat and cheeks, but otherwise her appearance
      did not alter. Recorder Hewitt seemed for a moment to discredit his
      senses. Then, suddenly straightening up and scowling at the jury-box, &rsquo;You
      have rendered an outrageous verdict; a verdict grossly at variance with
      the evidence,&rsquo; he said. &rsquo;You are one and all excused from further service
      in this tribunal.&rsquo; Turning to Mrs. Peixada, &rsquo;As for you, madam,&rsquo; he
      continued, &rsquo;you have been unrighteously acquitted of as heinous a crime as
      ever woman was guilty of. Your defense was a sham and a perjury. The ends
      of justice have been defeated, because, forsooth, you have a pretty face.
      You can go free. But let me counsel you to beware, in the future, how you
      tamper with the lives of human beings, better and worthier in every
      respect than yourself. I had hoped that it would be my duty and my
      privilege to sentence you to a life of hard labor in the prison at Sing
      Sing, if not to expiation of your sin upon the gallows. Unfortunately for
      the public welfare, and much to my personal regret, I have no alternative
      but to commit you to the keeping of your own guilty conscience, trusting
      that in time you may, by its action, and by the just horror with which
      your fellow-beings will shun your touch, be chastised and chastened. You
      are discharged.&rsquo; Mrs. Peixada bowed to the court, and left the room on the
      arm of her counsel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Undramatic and matter-of-fact though it was, Arthur got deeply absorbed in
      the perusal of this newspaper report of Mrs. Peixada&rsquo;s trial. When the
      jury returned from their deliberations, it was with breathless interest
      that he learned the result; he had forgotten that he already knew it. As
      the words &ldquo;Not guilty&rdquo; took shape before him, he drew a genuine sigh of
      relief. Then, at once recollecting himself, &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I was
      actually rejoicing at a miscarriage of justice. I am weak-minded.&rdquo; By and
      by he added, &ldquo;I wish, though, that I could get at the true inwardness of
      the matter&mdash;the secret motives that nobody but the murderess herself
      could reveal.&rdquo; For the sake of local color, he put on his hat and went
      over to the General Sessions court-room&mdash;now empty and in charge of a
      single melancholy officer&mdash;and tried to reconstruct the scene, with
      the aid of his imagination. The recorder had sat there, on the bench; the
      jury there; the prisoner there, at the counsel table. The atmosphere of
      the court-room was depressing. The four walls, that had listened to so
      many tales of sin and unhappiness, seemed to exude a deadly miasma. This
      room was reserved for the trial of criminal causes. How many hearts had
      here stood still for suspense! How many wretched secrets had here been
      uncovered! How many mothers and wives had wept here! How many
      guilt-burdened souls had here seen their last ray of light go out, and the
      shadows of the prison settle over them! The very tick-tack of the clock
      opposite the door sounded strangely ominous. Looking around him, Arthur
      felt his own heart grow cold, as if it had been touched with ice.

      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;&ldquo;THAT NOT IMPOSSIBLE SHE.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>T home that
      evening, on the <i>loggia</i>, Hetzel said, &ldquo;I have news for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; queried Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;about your mystery across the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s no longer a mystery. The ambiguity surrounding her has been
      dispelled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To start with, after you went down-town this morning, carts laden with
      furniture began to rattle into the street, and the furniture was carried
      into No. 46. It appears that they <i>have</i> taken the whole house, after
      all. They were merely camping out in the third story, while waiting for
      the advent of their goods and chattels. So we were jumping to a
      conclusion, when we put them down as poverty-stricken. The furniture was
      quite comfortable looking. It included, by the way, a second piano.
      Confess that you are disappointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I be disappointed? The divine voice remains, doesn&rsquo;t it? Go
      ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have learned their names.&mdash;The lady of the house is an
      elderly widow&mdash;Mrs. Gabrielle Hart. She has been living till recently
      in an apartment-house on Fifty-ninth Street, facing Central Park&mdash;&rsquo;The
      Modena&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the songstress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The songstress is Mrs. Hart&rsquo;s companion. She is also a Mrs.&mdash;Mrs.
      Lehmyl&mdash;L-e-h-m-y-l&mdash;picturesque name, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Lehmyl&mdash;who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Mrs. Lehmyl is a widow, too. She dresses in black.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you have seen her? Describe her to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t seen her. But Josephine has. It is to Josephine that I owe
      the information so far communicated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does Josephine say she looks like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Josephine doesn&rsquo;t say. She caught but a meteoric glimpse of her, as she
      stood for a moment this afternoon at her front door. Like the woman she
      is, she paid more attention to her costume than she did to her features.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, any thing further?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she sung for you since I left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bar. Probably she has been busy, helping to put the house to
      rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hope she will sing for us to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But bed-time stole upon them, and their hopes had not yet been rewarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The week wound away. Nothing new transpired concerning the occupants of
      No. 46. Mrs. Lehmyl sang almost every evening. But neither Arthur nor
      Hetzel nor Josephine succeeded in getting sight of her; which, of course,
      merely aggravated our hero&rsquo;s curiosity. Sunday afternoon he stood at the
      front window, gazing toward the corner house. The two cats, heretofore
      mentioned, were disporting themselves upon the window-ledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel, who was seated in the back part of the room, noticed that Arthur&rsquo;s
      attitude changed all at once from that of languid interest to that of
      sharp attention. His backbone became rigid, his neck craned forward; it
      was evident that something had happened. Presently he turned around, and
      remarked, with ill-disguised excitement, &ldquo;If&mdash;if you&rsquo;re anxious to
      make the acquaintance of that Mrs. Lehmyl, here&rsquo;s your chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It struck Hetzel that this was pretty good. &ldquo;If I am anxious to make her
      acquaintance!&rdquo; he said to himself. Aloud, &ldquo;Why, how is that?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;two ladies&mdash;she and Mrs. Hart, I suppose&mdash;have
      just left the corner house, and crossed the street, and entered our front
      door&mdash;to call on Mrs. Berle, doubtless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berle was the down-stairs neighbor of our friends&mdash;a middle-aged
      Jewish lady, whose husband, a commercial traveler, was commonly away from
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; questioned Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you ought to call on Mrs. Berle, anyway, you know. She has been so
      polite and kind, and has asked you to so often, that really it&rsquo;s no more
      than right that you should show her some little attention. Why not improve
      this occasion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Hetzel, yawning, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired. I prefer to stay home this
      afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense. You&rsquo;re simply lazy. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s positively a matter of
      duty, Hetz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you have so frequently asserted that I have no sense of duty, I&rsquo;m
      trying to live up to your conception of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a minute of silence, &ldquo;The fact of the matter is,&rdquo; ventured Arthur,
      &ldquo;that I too owe Mrs. Berle a visit, and&mdash;and won&rsquo;t you go down with
      me, as a favor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you put it on that ground, it&rsquo;s another question. As a favor to
      you, I consent to be dragged out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Arthur, casting off the mask of indifference that he had
      thus far clumsily worn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go change my coat, and come back in an
      instant. Wasn&rsquo;t I lucky to be posted there by the window at the moment of
      their exit? At last we shall see her with our own eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ere a great while, Mrs. Berle&rsquo;s maid-servant ushered them into Mrs.
      Berle&rsquo;s drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lehmyl was at the piano&mdash;playing, not singing. Arthur enjoyed a
      fine view of her back. My meaning is literal, when I say &ldquo;enjoyed.&rdquo;
       Impatient though he was to see her face, he took an indescribable pleasure
      in watching her back sway to and fro, as her fingers raced up and down the
      keyboard. Its contour was refined and symmetrical. Its undulations lent
      stress to the music, and denoted fervor on the part of the executant.
      Arthur can&rsquo;t tell what she was playing. It was something of Rubenstein&rsquo;s,
      the title of which escapes him&mdash;something, he says, as vigorous as a
      whirlwind&mdash;a bewitching melody sounding above a tempest of harmony&mdash;it
      was the restless, tumultuous, barbaric Rubenstein at his best.
    </p>
    <p>
      At its termination, the audience applauded vehemently, and demanded more.
      The result was a <i>Scherzo</i> by Chopin. Afterward, Mrs. Lehmyl rose
      from the piano and fanned herself. Every body began simultaneously to
      talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berle presented Hetzel and Arthur in turn to the two ladies. Of the
      latter she was kind enough to remark, &ldquo;Dot is a young lawyer down-town,
      and such a <i>goot</i> young man&rdquo;&mdash;which made him blush profusely and
      wish his hostess a dozen apoplexies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart was tall and spare, a severe looking woman of sixty, or
      thereabouts. She wore a gray poplin dress, and had stiff gray hair, and a
      network of gray veins across the backs of her hands. A penumbra upon her
      upper lip proved, when inspected, to be due to the presence of an
      incipient mustache. Her eyes were blue and good-natured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lehmyl&rsquo;s manner was at once dignified and gracious. Arthur made bold
      to declare, &ldquo;Your playing is equal to your singing, Mrs. Lehmyl&mdash;which
      is saying a vast deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is saying what is kind and pleasant,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but I fear, not
      strictly accurate. My playing is very faulty, I have so little time to
      practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is faulty, a premium ought to be placed upon such faults,&rdquo; he
      gushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lehmyl laughed, but vouchsafed no reply. &ldquo;And as for your singing,&rdquo;
       he continued, &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t mind my telling you how much I have
      enjoyed it. You can&rsquo;t conceive the pleasure it has given me, when I have
      come home, fagged out, from a day down-town, to hear you sing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad if it is so. I was afraid my musical pursuits might be a
      nuisance to the neighbors. I take for granted that you are a neighbor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Hetzel and I inhabit the upper portion of this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then you are the young men whom we have noticed on the roof. It is a
      brilliant idea, your roof. You dine up there, do you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go into the back room,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Berle; and she led the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the back room wine and cakes were distributed by a German <i>Madchen</i>
      in a French cap. The gentlemen&mdash;there were two or three present
      besides Arthur and Hetzel&mdash;lit their cigars. The ladies, of whom
      there were an equal number, with the exception of Mrs. Lehmyl, gathered in
      a knot around the center-table. Mrs. Lehmyl went to the bay-window and
      admired the view. It was, indeed, admirable. A crystalline atmosphere
      permitted one to see as far down the river as the Brooklyn Navy Yard; and
      leagues to the eastward, on Long Island, the marble of I know not what
      burying-ground glittered in the sun. An occasional schooner slipped past
      almost within stone&rsquo;s throw. On the wharf under the terrace, fifty odd
      yards away, an aged man placidly supported a fishing pole, and watched a
      cork that floated immobile upon the surface of the water. Over all bent
      the sky, intensely blue, and softened by a few white, fleecy clouds. But
      Arthur&rsquo;s faculties for admiration were engrossed by Mrs. Lehmyl&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think the first impression created by her face was one of power, rather
      than one of beauty. Not that it was in the slightest degree masculine, not
      that it was too strong to be intensely womanly. But at first sight,
      especially if it chanced then to be in repose, it seemed to embody the
      pride and the solemnity of womanhood, rather than its gentleness and
      flexibility. It was the face of a woman who could purpose and perform, who
      could suffer and be silent, who could command and be inexorable. The brow,
      crowned by black, waving hair, was low and broad, and as white as marble.
      The nose and chin were modeled on the pattern of the Ludovici Juno&rsquo;s. Your
      first notion was: &ldquo;This woman is calm, reserved, thoughtful, persistent.
      Her emotions are subordinated to her intellect. She has a tremendous will.
      She was cut out to be an empress.&rdquo; But the next instant you noticed her
      eyes and her mouth: and your conception had accordingly to be reframed.
      Her eyes, in color dark, translucent brown, were of the sort that your
      gaze can delve deep into, and discern a light shimmering at the bottom:
      eyes that send an electric spark into the heart of the man who looks upon
      them; eyes that are eloquent of pathos and passion and mystery. Her lips
      were full and ruddy, and indicated equal capacities for womanly tenderness
      and for girlish mirth. It was easy to fancy them curling in derisive
      laughter: it was quite as easy to fancy them quivering with intense
      emotion, or becoming compressed in pain. Insensibly, you added: &ldquo;No&mdash;not
      an empress: a heroine, a martyr to some noble human cause. It was like
      this that the Mother of Sorrows must have looked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was beautiful: on that score there could be no difference of opinion.
      Her appearance justified the expectations that her voice aroused. She was
      beautiful not in a pronounced, aggressive way, but in a quiet, subtle, and
      all the more potent way. Her beauty was of the sort that grows upon one,
      the longer one studies it; rather than of the sort that, bullet-like,
      produces its greatest effect at once. Join to this that she was manifestly
      young, at the utmost five-and-twenty, and the reader will not wonder that
      Arthur&rsquo;s antecedent interest in her had mounted several degrees. I must
      not forget to mention her hands. These were a trifle larger than it is the
      fashion for a lady&rsquo;s hands to be; but they were shaped and colored to
      perfection, and they had an unconscious habit of toying with each other,
      as their owner talked or listened, that made it a charm to watch them.
      They were suggestive hands. Arthur felt that, had he understood the
      language of hands, he could, by observing these, have divined a number of
      Mrs. Lehmyl&rsquo;s secrets; and he bethought him of an old treatise on
      palmistry that lay gathering dust in his book-case up-stairs. Around her
      wrist she wore a bracelet of amber beads. She was dressed entirely in
      black, and had a sprig of mignonette pinned in her button-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      As has been said, she admired the view. &ldquo;I am so glad we have come to live
      in Beekman Place,&rdquo; she added; &ldquo;it is such a contrast to the rest of dusty,
      noisy, hot New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To hear this woman utter small talk,&rdquo; says Arthur, &ldquo;was like seeing a
      giant lift straws. I half wished that she would not speak at all, unless
      to proclaim mighty truths in hexameters. Still, had she kept silence, I am
      sure I should have been disappointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was much amused by the old fisherman down on the wharf; wondered
      whether he had met with any luck; and thought that such patient devotion
      as he displayed, merited recognition on the part of the fishes. She was
      curious to know what the granite buildings were on Blackwell&rsquo;s Island.
      Arthur undertook the office of cicerone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prison and hospital and graveyard constantly in sight,&rdquo; was her comment;
      &ldquo;I should think they would make one gloomy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>A memento mori</i>, as one&rsquo;s eyes feast on sky and water. On moonlight
      nights in summer, it is superb here&mdash;quite Venetian. Every now and
      then some dark, mysterious craft, slowly drifting by, reminds one of
      Elaine&rsquo;s barge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be very beautiful,&rdquo; she said, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture an excursion steamboat made its appearance upon the
      river, and conversation was suspended till it had passed. It was gay with
      bunting and black with humanity. It strove its best to render day hideous
      by dispensing a staccato version of &ldquo;Home, Sweet Home&rdquo; from the blatant
      throat of a <i>Calliope</i>&mdash;an instrument consisting of a series of
      steam whistles graduated in chromatic scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How uncomfortable those poor people must be,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lehmyl. &ldquo;Is&mdash;is
      this one of the dark, mysterious craft?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a product of our glorious American civilization. None but an
      alchemist with true American instincts, would ever have thought of
      transmuting steam to music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Music?&rdquo; queried Mrs. Lehmyl, dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur was about to qualify his use of the term when the door opened and
      admitted a procession of Mrs. Berle&rsquo;s daughters and sons-in-law. An uproar
      of greetings and presentations followed. The men exchanged remarks about
      the weather and the state of trade; the women, kisses and inquiries
      concerning health. Bits of news were circulated. &ldquo;Lester Bar is engaged to
      Emma Frankenstiel,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mrs. Seitel&rsquo;s baby was born yesterday&mdash;another
      girl,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Du lieber Gott!</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Ist&rsquo;s moglich?</i>&rdquo; and so on; a
      breezy mingling of German with English, of statement with expletive; the
      whole emphasized by an endless swaying of heads and lifting of eyebrows.
      The wine and cakes made a second tour of the room. Fresh cigars were
      lighted. The ladies fell to comparing notes about their respective
      offspring. One of the gentlemen volunteered a circumstantial account of a
      Wagner concert he had attended the night previous. It was a long while
      before any thing resembling quiet was restored. Arthur seized the first
      opportunity that presented itself to edge back to Mrs. Lehmyl&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this talk about music,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has whetted my appetite. You are
      going to sing for us, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t dare to, in this assemblage of Wagnerites. The sort of
      music that I can sing would seem heresy from their point of view. I can&rsquo;t
      sing Wagner, and I shouldn&rsquo;t venture upon any thing so retrograde as
      Schumann or Schubert. Besides, I&rsquo;m rather tired to-day, and&mdash;so
      please don&rsquo;t introduce the subject. Mrs. Berle might follow it up; and if
      she asked me, I couldn&rsquo;t very well refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lehmyl&rsquo;s tone showed that she meant what she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a great disappointment,&rdquo; Arthur rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how anxious I am to hear you sing at close quarters. But
      as for your music being retrograde, why, only the other night I was
      admiring your fine taste in making selections. <i>Wohin</i>, for instance.
      Isn&rsquo;t <i>Wohin</i> abreast of the times?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Wagnerites wouldn&rsquo;t think so. It is melody. Therefore it is&mdash;good
      enough for the uninitiated, perhaps&mdash;but not to be put up with by
      people of serious musical cultivation. The only passages in Wagner&rsquo;s own
      work that his disciples take exception to, are those where, in a fit of
      artistic obliquity, he has become truly melodious. Here, they think, he
      has been guilty of backsliding. His melodies were the short-comings of
      genius&mdash;pardonable, in consideration of their infrequency, but in no
      wise to be commended. The further he gets away from the old standards of
      excellence&mdash;the more perplexing, complicated, artificial, soporific,
      he becomes&mdash;the better are his enthusiasts pleased. The other day I
      was talking with one of them, and in the desire to say something pleasant,
      I spoke of how supremely beautiful the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Chorus is in Tannhâuser.
      A look of sadness fell upon my friend&rsquo;s face, and I saw that I had
      blundered. &rsquo;Ah,&rsquo; she cried, &rsquo;don&rsquo;t speak of that. It makes my heart ache
      to think that the master could have let himself down to any thing so
      trivial.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s their pet word&mdash;trivial. Whenever a theme is
      comprehensible, they dispose of it as trivial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur laughed and said, &ldquo;It is evident to what school you belong. For my
      part, I always suspect that when a composer disdains to write melodies, it
      is a case of sour grapes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he lacks the inventive faculty, and then affects to despise it,&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Lehmyl. &ldquo;My taste is very old-fashioned. Of course every body
      must recognize Wagner&rsquo;s greatness, and must appreciate him in his best
      moods. But when he cuts loose from all the established laws of composition&mdash;well,
      I heard my sentiments neatly expressed once by Signor Zacchinelli, the
      maestro. &rsquo;It is ze music of ze future?&rsquo; he inquired. &rsquo;Zen I am glad I
      shall be dead.&rsquo; Smiting his breast he went on, &rsquo;I want somezing to make me
      feel good <i>here</i>.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the trouble. Except when Wagner abides by
      the old traditions, he never makes one feel good <i>here</i>. The pleasure
      he affords is intellectual rather than emotional. He amazes you by the
      intricate harmonies he constructs, but he doesn&rsquo;t touch your heart. Now
      and then he forgets himself&mdash;is borne away from his theories on the
      wings of an inspiration&mdash;and then he is superb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; Arthur asked, by and by, &ldquo;whether you can tell me what it was
      that you sang the evening I first heard you. It was more than a week ago&mdash;a
      week ago Friday. At about sunset time, we were out on our roof, and you
      sang something that I had never heard before,&mdash;something soft and
      plaintive, with a refrain that went like this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; humming a bar
      or two of the refrain. &ldquo;Oh, that? Did you like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, indeed. I thought it was exquisite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad, because it is a favorite of my own. It&rsquo;s an old French
      folk-song, arranged by Bizet. The title is <i>Le Voile d&rsquo;une Religieuse</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could hear it again. I can&rsquo;t tell you how charming it was to sit
      there in the open air, and watch the sunset, and listen to that song.
      Only, it was so exasperating not to be able to see the songstress. Won&rsquo;t
      you be persuaded to sing it now? I&rsquo;m sure you are not too tired to sing
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Here? I should never be absolved. The auditors&mdash;I dare not
      fancy what the effect upon them might be. That song, of all things! Why,
      it is worse than Schubert.&mdash;But seriously,&rdquo; she added, gravely, &ldquo;I
      could not bear to expose any thing so dear to me as my music is, to the
      ridicule it would provoke from the Wagnerites. It hurts me keenly to hear
      a song that I love, picked to pieces, and made light of, and tossed to the
      winds. It hurts me just as keenly to hear it praised insincerely&mdash;merely
      for politeness&rsquo; sake. Music&mdash;true music&mdash;is like prayer. It is
      too sacred to&mdash;you know what I mean&mdash;to be laid bare to the
      contempt of unbelievers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, like prayer. It is the most perfect vehicle of expression
      for one&rsquo;s deepest, most solemn feelings&mdash;that and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And poetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you guess that I was going to say poetry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was obvious. The two go together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they do. Do you know, Mrs. Lehmyl, if I were to try my hand at
      guesswork, I think I could name your favorite poet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed; who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert Browning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lehmyl cast a half surprised, half startled glance at Arthur. &ldquo;Are
      you a mind-reader? Or was it simply a chance hit?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I was right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you were right, though I ought not to tell you so. You ought not to
      know your power, if power it was, and not mere random&rsquo; guesswork. One with
      that faculty of penetrating another&rsquo;s mind must be a dangerous associate.
      But tell me, what hint did I let fall, that made you suspect I should be
      fond of Browning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I should answer that question, I am afraid you might deem me
      presumptuous. I could not do so, without paying you a compliment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, leave it unanswered,&rdquo; she said, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Mrs. Hart rose and bade good-by to Mrs. Berle; then called
      across to Mrs. Lehmyl, &ldquo;Come, Ruth;&rdquo; and the latter wished Arthur good
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and Hetzel left soon after. Mrs. Berle said, &ldquo;If you young gentlemen
      have no other engagement, won&rsquo;t you take tea here a week from to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; Hetzel answered; &ldquo;and we shall do so with great
      pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upstairs, &ldquo;Well, how did you like her?&rdquo; inquired Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like whom? Mrs. Berle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;Mrs. Lehmyl, of course, stupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty question for you to ask; as though you&rsquo;d given me a
      chance to find out. How did <i>you</i> like her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s above the average.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all? Then you were disappointed? She didn&rsquo;t come up to your
      anticipations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t say that. Yes, she&rsquo;s# a fine woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But her friend, Mrs. Hart, is a trump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So? Nobody would suspect it from her looks. Her austere coloring inspires
      a certain kind of awe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s no longer young. But she&rsquo;s very agreeable, all the same. We talked
      a good deal together. She asked me to call. You weren&rsquo;t a bit clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. If you had been, you would have devoted yourself to Mrs. Hart.
      Then she would have invited you to call, too. So you could have cultivated
      Mrs. Lehmyl at your leisure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you and I are one. You can take me to call with you, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. She asked me to drop in informally any
      afternoon. You&rsquo;re never home in the afternoon. Besides, you&rsquo;re old enough
      to receive an invitation for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! You can arrange it easily enough. Ask permission to bring your
      Fidus Achates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see about it. If you behave yourself for the next week or two,
      perhaps I&rsquo;ll exert my influence. By the way, how did you like Mrs.
      Lehmyl&rsquo;s playing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She played uncommonly well&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I did. Execution and expression were both fine. She has studied
      in Europe, Mrs. Hart says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you learn who her husband is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I learned that he isn&rsquo;t. I was right in my conjecture. She is a widow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a relief. I am glad she is not-encumbered with a husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie upon you, man! You ought to be ashamed to say it. He has been dead
      quite a number of years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a number of years? Why, she can&rsquo;t be more than twenty-four or five
      years old&mdash;and besides, she&rsquo;s still in mourning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s about her age. But the mourning doesn&rsquo;t signify, because
      it&rsquo;s becoming to her; and so she would naturally keep it up as long as
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That introduces the point of chief importance. What did you think of her
      appearance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she has magnificent eyes, and looks refined and interesting&mdash;looks
      as though she knew what sorrow meant, too&mdash;only, perhaps the least
      bit cold. No, cold isn&rsquo;t the word. Say dignified, serious, a woman with
      whom one could never be familiar&mdash;in whose presence one would always
      feel a little&mdash;a little constrained. That isn&rsquo;t exactly what I mean,
      either. You understand&mdash;one would always have to be on one&rsquo;s guard
      not to say any thing flippant or trivial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean she looks as though she were deficient in levity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as though she wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate any thing petty&mdash;a dialogue
      such as ours now, for example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you have formed a correct notion of her, or not.
      Cold she certainly isn&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;s an enthusiast on the subject of music. And
      when we were talking about Wagner, she&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t exactly flippant&mdash;but
      she showed that she could be jocose. There&rsquo;s something about her that&rsquo;s
      exceedingly impressive, I don&rsquo;t know what it is. But I know that she made
      me feel, somehow, very small. She made me feel that underneath her quiet
      manner&mdash;hidden away somewhere in her frail woman&rsquo;s body&mdash;there
      was the capability of immense power. She reminded me of the women in
      Robert Browning&rsquo;s poetry&mdash;of the heroine of the &rsquo;Inn Album&rsquo;
      especially. Yet she said nothing remarkable&mdash;nothing to justify such
      an estimate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were affected by her personal magnetism. A woman with eyes like hers&mdash;and
      mighty scarce they are&mdash;always gives you the idea of power. Young as
      she is, I suspect she&rsquo;s been through a good deal. She has had her
      experiences. That seems to be written on her face. Yet she didn&rsquo;t strike
      me as having the peach-bloom rubbed off&mdash;though, of course, I had no
      chance to examine her closely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; the peach-bloom is there in abundance. Well, at all events, she&rsquo;s
      a problem which it will be interesting to solve. By the way, what
      possessed you to accept Mrs. Berle&rsquo;s invitation to tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What possessed me? Why should I have done otherwise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be an insufferable bore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it that somewhat earlier in the afternoon preached me a sermon on
      the duties we owe that identical Mrs. Berle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur spent the evening reading. Hetzel, peeping over his shoulder, saw
      that the book of his choice was &ldquo;The Inn Album&rdquo; by Robert Browning.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.&mdash;&ldquo;A NOTHING STARTS THE SPRING.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NOTHER week
      slipped away. The weather changed. There was rain almost every day, and a
      persistent wind blew from the north-east. So the <i>loggia</i> of No. 43
      Beekman Place was not much patronized. Nevertheless, Arthur heard Mrs.
      Lehmyl sing from time to time. When he would reach home at night, he
      generally ensconced himself near to a window at the front of the house;
      and now and then his vigilance was encouraged by the sound of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel, of course, ran him a good deal. He took the running very
      philosophically. &ldquo;I admit,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that she piques my curiosity, and I
      don&rsquo;t know any reason why she shouldn&rsquo;t. Such a voice, joined to such
      beauty and intelligence, is it not enough to interest any body with the
      least spark of imagination? When are you going to call upon them?&rdquo; But
      Hetzel was busy. &ldquo;Examinations are now in full blast,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;I have
      no leisure for calling on any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It sometimes make a body sour to see how things are shared,&rsquo;.rdquo; complained
      Arthur. &ldquo;To him who appreciates it not, the privilege is given; whereas,
      from him who would appreciate it to its full, the privilege is withheld. I
      only wish I had your opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel smiled complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; Arthur went on, &ldquo;not even an occasional encounter in the
      street. Every day, coming and going, I cherish the hope that we may meet
      each other, she and I. Living so close together, it would be but natural
      if we should. But I&rsquo;m down in my luck. We might as well dwell at the
      antipodes, for all we gain by being near neighbors. Concede that Fate is
      deucedly unkind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; said Hetzel, reflectively. &ldquo;Perhaps Fate is
      acting for the best. My private opinion is that the less you see of that
      woman, the better for you. You&rsquo;re a pretty susceptible young man; and
      those eyes of hers might play sad havoc with your affections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the way with you worldly, practical, materialistic fellows.
      You can&rsquo;t conceive that a man may be interested in a woman, without making
      a fool of himself, and getting spoony over her. You haven&rsquo;t enough
      spiritualism in your composition to realize that a woman may appeal to a
      man purely on abstract principles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cynic,&rdquo; Arthur informed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in playing with fire,&rdquo; he retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter their conversation drifted to other themes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the week glided by, and it was Sunday again; and with Sunday there
      occurred another change in the weather. The mercury shot up among the
      eighties, and the sky grew to an immense dome of blue. Sunday morning
      Hetzel said, &ldquo;I suppose you haven&rsquo;t forgotten that we are engaged to sup
      with Mrs. Berle this evening?&rdquo; To which Arthur responded, yawning, &ldquo;Oh,
      no; it has weighed upon my consciousness ever since you accepted her
      invitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let it distress me so much, if I were you. And, by the way,
      don&rsquo;t you think it would be well for us to take some flowers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it would be a polite thing to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you make an excursion over to the florist&rsquo;s on Third
      Avenue, and lay in an assortment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the horticulturist of this establishment. Go yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Your taste is superior to mine. Go along. Get a goodly number of cut
      flowers, and then two or three nosegays for the ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies? What ladies?&rdquo; demanded Arthur, brightening up. &ldquo;Who is to be
      there, besides us and Mrs. Berle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t say that any body is. I thought perhaps one of her daughters,
      or a friend, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, maybe I&rsquo;ll go over this afternoon. For the present&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This afternoon will be too late. The shops close early, you know, on
      Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur issued forth upon his quest for flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it that prompted him, after the main purchase had been made, to
      ask the tradesman, &ldquo;Now, have you something especially nice, something
      unique, that would do for a lady&rsquo;s corsage?&rdquo; The shopkeeper replied, &ldquo;Yes,
      sir, I have something very rare in the line of jasmine. Only a handful in
      the market. This way, sir.&rdquo;&mdash;Arthur was conducted to the conservatory
      behind the shop; and there he devoted a full quarter hour of his valuable
      time to the construction of a very pretty and fragrant bunch of jasmine.
      What was it that induced this action?
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got back home and displayed his spoils to Hetzel, the latter said,
      &ldquo;And this jasmine&mdash;I suppose you intend it for Mrs. Berle to wear,
      yes?&rdquo; To which Arthur vouchsafed no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went down stairs at six o&rsquo;clock. Mrs. Berle was alone in her parlor.
      They had scarcely more than made their obeisance, however, when the
      door-bell rang; and presently the rustle of ladies&rsquo; gowns became audible
      in the hallway. Next moment the door opened&mdash;and Arthur&rsquo;s heart began
      to beat at break-neck speed. Entered, Mrs. Hart and Mrs. Lehmyl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I surmised as much, and you knew it all the while,&rdquo; Arthur gasped in a
      whisper to Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first clamor of greetings being over with, Arthur, his bunch of
      jasmine held fast in his hand, began, &ldquo;Mrs. Lehmyl, may I beg of you to
      accept these little&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, aren&rsquo;t they delicious!&rdquo; she cried, impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes brightened, and she bent over the flowers to breathe in their
      incense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I mustn&rsquo;t keep them all for myself,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we are equally well treated,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hart, flourishing a knot of
      Jacqueminot roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; Mrs. Berle joined in, pointing to a table, the marble top
      of which was hidden beneath a wealth of variegated blossoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lehmyl. And she went on picking her bouquet to
      pieces. Mrs. Hart and Mrs. Berle received their shares; Hetzel his; and
      then, turning to Arthur, &ldquo;<i>Maintenant, monsieur</i>&rdquo; she said, with a
      touch of coquetry, &ldquo;<i>maintenant à votre tour</i>.&rdquo; She fastened a spray
      of jasmine to the lappel of his coat. In doing so, a delicate whiff of
      perfume was wafted upward from her hair. Whether it possessed some
      peculiar elixir-like quality, or not, I can not tell; but at that instant
      Arthur felt a thrill pierce to the very innermost of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so warm,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berle, &ldquo;I thought it would be pleasant to take
      supper out of doors. If you are agreeable, we will go down to the
      backyard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the back-yard the table was set beneath a blossoming peach-tree. The
      grass plot made an unexceptionable carpet. Honeysuckle vines clambered
      over the fence. The river glowed warmly in the light of the declining sun.
      The country beyond on Long Island lay smiling at the first persuasive
      touch of summer&mdash;of the summer that, ere long waxing fiercely ardent,
      was to scorch and consume it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lehmyl looked around, with child-like happiness shining in her eyes.
      Arthur looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to make you acquainted with my brother, Mr. Lipman,&rdquo; said the
      hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lipman had a head that the Wandering Jew might have been proud of;
      snow-white hair and beard, olive skin, regular features of the finest
      Oriental type, and deep-set, coal-black eyes, with an expression in them&mdash;an
      anxious, eager, hopelessly hopeful expression&mdash;that told the whole
      story of the travail and sorrow of his race. He kissed the hands of the
      ladies and shook those of the gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, to the table!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Berle.

      The table was of appetizing aspect; an immaculate cloth, garnished by
      divers German dishes, and beautified by the flowers our friends had
      brought. Arthur&rsquo;s chair was placed at the right of Mrs. Lehmyl&rsquo;s.
      Conversation, however, was general from first to last. Hetzel contributed
      an anecdote in the Irish dialect, at which he was an adept. Arthur told of
      a comic incident that had happened in court the other day. Mrs. Lehmyl
      said she could not fancy any thing being comic in a courtroom&mdash;the
      atmosphere of a court-room sent such a chill to the heart, she should
      think it would operate as an anaesthetic upon the humorous side of a
      person. Mr. Lipman gave a few reminiscences of the Hungarian revolt of
      &rsquo;49, in which he had been a participant, wielding a brace of empty seltzer
      bottles, so he said, in default of nobler weapons. This led the talk up to
      the superiority of America over the effete monarchies of Europe. After a
      good deal of patriotism had asserted itself, a little criticism began to
      crop out. By and by the Goddess of Liberty had had her character
      thoroughly dissected. With the coffee, Mrs. Berle, who had heretofore
      shone chiefly as a listener, said, &ldquo;Now, you young gentlemen may smoke,
      just as if you were three flights higher up.&rdquo; So they lit their cigars&mdash;in
      which pastime Mr. Lipman joined them&mdash;and sat smoking and chatting
      over the table till it had grown quite dark. At last it was moved that the
      party should adjourn to the parlor and have some music. There being no
      Wagnerites present, Mrs. Lehmyl sang Jensen&rsquo;s <i>Lehn deine Wang</i>, with
      so much fervor that two big tears gathered in Mr. Lipman&rsquo;s eyes and rolled
      down his cheeks. Then, to restore gayety, she sang <i>La Paloma</i>, in
      the merriest way imaginable; and finally, to bring the pendulum of emotion
      back to its mean position, <i>Voi chi Sapete</i> from the &ldquo;Marriage of
      Figaro.&rdquo; After this there was an interim during which every body found
      occasion to say his say; and then Mrs. Berle announced, &ldquo;My brother plays
      the &rsquo;cello. Now he must also play a little, yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lehmyl was delighted by the prospect of hearing the &rsquo;cello played;
      and Mr. Lipman performed a courtly old bow, and said it would be a
      veritable inspiration to play to her accompaniment. Thereupon they
      consulted together until they had agreed upon a selection. It proved to be
      nothing less antiquated than Boccherini&rsquo;s minuet. The quaint and graceful
      measures, wrung out from the deep-voiced &rsquo;cello, brought smiles of
      enjoyment to every face. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; says Arthur, &ldquo;what pleased me quite as
      much as the music was to keep my eyes fixed on the picture that the two
      musicians presented; that old man&rsquo;s wonderful countenance, peering out
      from behind the neck of his instrument, intent, almost fierce in its
      earnestness; and hers, pale, luminous, passionate, varying with every
      modulation of the tune. And all the while the scent of the jasmine bud
      haunted my nostrils, and recalled vividly the moment she had pinned it
      into my buttonhole.&rdquo;&mdash;In deference to the demand for an encore, they
      played Handel&rsquo;s <i>Largo</i>. Then Mrs. Berle&rsquo;s maid appeared, bearing the
      inevitable wine and cakes. By and by Mrs. Hart began to make her adieux.
      At this, Arthur slipped quietly out of the room. When he returned, half a
      minute later, he had his hat in his hand. Mrs. Hart protested that it was
      quite unnecessary for him to trouble himself to see them home. &ldquo;Why, it is
      only straight across the street,&rdquo; she submitted. But Arthur was obstinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her door-step, Mrs. Hart said, &ldquo;We should be pleased to have you call
      upon us, Mr. Ripley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He and Hetzel sat up till past midnight, talking. The latter volunteered a
      good many favorable observations anent Mrs. Lehmyl. Arthur could have
      listened to him till daybreak.&mdash;In bed he had difficulty getting to
      sleep. Among other things, he kept thinking how fortunate it was that
      Peixada had disapproved of the trip to Europe. &ldquo;Why, New York,&rdquo; he
      soliloquized, &ldquo;is by all means the most interesting city in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took advantage of Mrs. Hart&rsquo;s permission to call, as soon as he
      reasonably could. While he was waiting for somebody to appear, he admired
      the decorations of Mrs. Hart&rsquo;s parlor. Neat gauze curtains at the windows,
      a rosy-hued paper on the wall, a soft carpet under foot, pretty pictures,
      pleasant chairs and tables, lamps and porcelains, and a book-case filled
      with interesting looking books, combined to lend the room an attractive,
      homelike aspect; for all of which, without cause, Arthur assumed that Mrs.
      Lehmyl was answerable. An upright piano occupied a corner; a sheet of
      music lay open on the rack. He was bending over it, to spell out the
      composer&rsquo;s name, when he heard a rustling of silk, and, turning around, he
      made his bow to&mdash;Mrs. Hart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart was accompanied by her cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur&rsquo;s spirits sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, how do you do?&rdquo; said Mrs. Hart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook his hand cordially and bade him be seated. He sat down and
      looked at the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you bring your comrade, Mr. Hetzel?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Hetzel, he&rsquo;s got an examination on his hands, you know, and has
      perforce become a recluse&mdash;obliged to spend his evenings wading
      through the students&rsquo; papers,&rdquo; explained Arthur, in a tone of sepulchral
      melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart tried to manufacture conversation. Arthur responded
      absent-mindedly. Neither alluded to Mrs. Lehmyl. Arthur, fearing to appear
      discourteous, endeavored to behave as though it was to profit by Mrs.
      Hart&rsquo;s society alone that he had called. His voice, notwithstanding, kept
      acquiring a more and more lugubrious quality. But, by and by, when the
      flame of hope had dwindled to a spark, a second rustling of silk became
      audible. With a heart-leap that for a moment rendered him dumb, he heard a
      sweet voice say, &ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Ripley.&rdquo; He lifted his eyes, and saw
      Mrs. Lehmyl standing before him, smiling and proffering her hand. Silently
      cursing his embarrassment, he possessed himself of the hand, and stammered
      out some sort of a greeting. There was a magic about that hand of hers. As
      he touched it, an electric tingle shot up his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      All three found chairs. Mrs. Hart produced a bag of knitting. One of the
      cats established himself in Mrs. Lehmyl&rsquo;s lap, and went to sleep. The
      other rubbed up against Arthur&rsquo;s knee, purring confidentially. Arthur
      cudgeled his wits for an apt theme. At last he got bravely started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fine-looking old fellow that Mr. Lipman was,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
      often that one sees a face like his in America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not among the Americans of English blood; they haven&rsquo;t enough
      temperamental richness,&rdquo; acquiesced Mrs. Lehmyl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so. The most interesting faces one encounters here belong to
      foreigners&mdash;especially to the Jews. Mr. Lipman, you know, is a Jew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally, being Mrs. Berle&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather odd, Mrs. Lehmyl, but the more I see of the Jews, the better
      I like them. Aside from the interest they possess as a phenomenon in
      history, they&rsquo;re very agreeable to me as individuals. I can&rsquo;t at all
      comprehend the prejudice that some people harbor against them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very liberal,&rdquo; If there was a shade of irony in her tone, it failed
      of its effect upon Arthur, who, inspired by his subject, went gallantly
      on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their past, you know, is so poetic. They have the warmth of old wine in
      their blood. I&rsquo;ve seen a great deal of them. This neighborhood is a
      regular ghetto. Then down-town I rub elbows with them constantly. Indeed,
      my best client is a Jew. And my friend, Hetzel, he&rsquo;s of Jewish extraction,
      though he doesn&rsquo;t keep up with the religion. On the average, I think the
      Jews are the kindest-hearted and clearest-minded people one meets
      hereabouts. That Mr. Lipman was a specimen of the highest type. It was
      delightful to watch his face, when you and he were playing&mdash;so
      fervent, so unselfconscious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he played capitally, too&mdash;caught the true spirit of the music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it seemed to me, though of course, I&rsquo;m not competent to criticise.
      Speaking of faces, Mrs. Lehmyl, I hope you won&rsquo;t mind me saying that your
      face does not look to me like and American&mdash;I mean English-American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no reason why it should. I&rsquo;m not&rsquo; English-American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I felt sure of it. I felt sure you had Italian blood in your veins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;nor Italian either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Spanish, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I supposed you knew. I&mdash;I am a Jewess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; gasped Arthur, blushing to the roots of his hair. &ldquo;I hope&mdash;I
      hope you&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off, and squirmed uncomfortably in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, is it possible you didn&rsquo;t know it?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Lehmyl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I did not. If I had, I assure you, I shouldn&rsquo;t have put my foot
      in it as I did&mdash;shouldn&rsquo;t have made bold to patronize your race as I
      was doing. I meant every word I spoke, though. The Jews are a noble and
      beautiful people, with a record that we Gentiles might well envy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said nothing that was not perfectly proper. Don&rsquo;t imagine for an
      instant that you touched a sensitive spot. I am a Jewess by birth, though,
      like your friend, Mr. Hetzel, I don&rsquo;t go to the temple. Modern ceremonial
      Judaism is not to me especially satisfying as a religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not orthodox?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear it. I am glad that there is this tendency amoung the
      better educated Jews to cast loose from their Judaism. I want to see them
      intermarry with the Christians&mdash;amalgamate, and help to form the
      American people of the future. That of course is their destiny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak as though you regretted it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t regret it. I am too good an American to regret it. But it is
      a little melancholy, to say the least, to see one of the most cherished of
      Jewish ideals being abandoned before the first step is made toward
      realizing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ideal is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the hope that cheered the Jews through the many centuries of their
      persecution&mdash;the hope that a time would come when they could compel
      recognition from their persecutors, when, as a united people, they could
      stand forth before the world, pure and strong and upright, and exact
      credit for their due. The Jew has been for so long a time the despised and
      rejected of men, that now, when he has the opportunity, it seems as though
      he ought to improve it&mdash;show the stuff he is made of, prove that
      Shylock is a libel upon him, justify his past, achieve great results,
      demonstrate that he only needed light and liberty to develop into a leader
      of progress. The Jew has eternally been complaining&mdash;crying, &rsquo;You
      think I am such an inferior style of personage; give me a chance, and I
      will convince you of your error.&rsquo; Now that the chance is given him, it
      seems a pity for him quietly to efface himself, become indistinguishable
      in the mass of mankind. I should like him to retain the name of Jew until
      it has grown to be a term of honor, instead of one of reproach. However,
      his destiny is otherwise; and he must make the best of it. It is the
      destiny of the dew-drop to slip into the shining sea.&rsquo; Probably it is
      better that it should be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how many Jews are there who would subscribe to your view of the case&mdash;who
      would admit that amalgamation is inevitable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless, very few. Most of them have no views at all on the subject.
      The majority of the wealthier Jews here in America are epicureans. Eat,
      drink, be merry, and lay up a competence for the rainy day, is about their
      philosophy. But among the older people the prejudice against intermarriage
      is wonderfully strong. We shall have to wait for a generation or two,
      before it can become common. But it is a prejudice pure and simple, the
      offspring of superstition, and not the result of allegiance to that ideal
      I was speaking of. The average Jew of a certain age may not care a fig for
      his religion, but if he hears of an instance of intermarriage, he will
      hold up his hands in horror, and wag his head, and predict some dire
      calamity for the bride and bridegroom. The same man will not enter a
      synagogue from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end, and should you happen to discuss
      theology with him, you&rsquo;d put him down for an out-and-out rationalist at
      once. But then, plenty of people who pride themselves on being
      freethinkers, are profoundly superstitious&mdash;Gentiles as well as
      Jews.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt about that. In fact, I think that every body has a trace of
      superstition in his makeup, no matter how emancipated he may fancy
      himself. Now I, for example, can&rsquo;t help attributing some uncanny potency
      to the number seven. There are more things in heaven and earth than are
      dreamed of by modern science; and perhaps superstition is a crude way of
      acknowledging this truth. It is the reaction of the imagination, when
      confronted with the unknowable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me that much which passes for superstition in the world,
      ought not to be so called. It is, rather, a super-sense. There is a subtle
      something that broods over human life&mdash;as the aroma broods over a
      goblet of old wine&mdash;a something of such fine, impalpable texture,
      that many men and women are never able to perceive it, but which others of
      more sensitive organization, feel all the time&mdash;are forever conscious
      of. This is the material which the imagination seizes hold of, and out of
      which it spins those fantastic, cobweb shapes that practical persons scoff
      at as superstitions. I can&rsquo;t understand, however, how any body can
      specialize it to the extent of linking it to arithmetic, as you do, and as
      those do who are afraid of thirteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you have reference to falls, rather, under the head of mysticism,
      does it not? And mysticism is one form of poetry. You come rightfully by
      your ideas on this subject. A strain of mysticism is your birthright, a
      portion of your inheritance as a Jewess. It&rsquo;s one of the benefits you
      derive from being something more than an American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I am an American, besides. It is a privilege to be one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant American of English ancestry. We are all Americans&mdash;or more
      precisely, we are all immigrants or the descendants of immigrants. But
      those of us that have an infusion of warmer blood than the English in our
      veins, are to be congratulated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me that Ripley is an English name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is. But my father&rsquo;s mother was a Frenchwoman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A ruddy drop of Gallic blood outweighs a world of gold,&rdquo; parodied Mrs.
      Lehmyl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you may make fun of me, if you like,&rdquo; cried Arthur; &ldquo;but my comfort
      in thinking of that French grandmother of mine will remain undiminished. I
      wonder,&rdquo; he added, more gravely, &ldquo;I wonder whether you have ever suffered
      from any of the indignities that your people are sometimes put to, Mrs.
      Lehmyl. I declare I have been tempted to wring the necks of my fellow
      Gentiles, now and then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suffered? I have occasionally been amused. I should not have much
      self-respect, if any thing like that could cause me suffering. Last
      summer, for instance, Mrs. Hart and I were in the mountains, at a hotel.
      Every body, to begin with, was disposed to be very sociable. Then,
      innocently enough, one day I said we were Jewesses. After that we were
      left severely alone. I remember, we got into an omnibus one afternoon to
      drive to the village. A young man and a couple of young ladies&mdash;guests
      at the same house&mdash;were already in it. They glared at us quite
      savagely, and whispered, &rsquo;<i>Jews!</i>&rsquo; and signaled the driver to stop
      and let them out. So we had the conveyance to ourselves, for which we were
      not sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had been there!&rdquo; cried Arthur, with astonishing energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Lehmyl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that young man and I would have had an interview alone,&rdquo; he answered,
      in a blood-curdling key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He means that he would have given that young man a piece of his mind,&rdquo;
       put in Mrs. Hart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of her voice occasioned Arthur a veritable start. He had
      forgotten that she was present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lehmyl. &ldquo;To resent such conduct would lend undue
      importance to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same it makes my blood boil&mdash;the thought that those young
      animals dared to be rude to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pronoun &ldquo;you&rdquo; was spoken with a significant emphasis. A student of
      human nature could have inferred volumes from it. Mrs. Hart straightway
      proceeded to demolish her own claims to be called a student of human
      nature, if she had any, by construing the syllable in the plural number.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we appreciate your sympathy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ruth, play a little for
      Mr. Ripley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was this intended as a reward of merit? Contrariwise to the gentleman in
      <i>Punch</i>, Arthur would so much rather have heard her talk than play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I should be delighted,&rdquo; he assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      She played the Pathetic Sonata. Before she had got beyond the first dozen
      bars, Arthur had been caught up and borne away on the strong current of
      the music. She played with wonderful execution and perfect feeling. I
      suppose Arthur had heard the Pathetic Sonata a score of times before. He
      had never begun to appreciate it till now. It seemed to him that in a
      language of superhuman clearness and directness, the subtlest and most
      sacred mysteries of the soul were being explained to him. Every emotion,
      every passion, that the heart can feel, he seemed to hear expressed by the
      miraculous voice that Mrs. Lehmyl was calling into being; and his own
      heart vibrated in unison. Deep melancholy, breathless terror, keen,
      quivering anguish, blank despair; flashes of short-lived joy, instants of
      hope speedily ingulfed in an eternity of despond; tremulous desire, the
      delirium of enjoyment, the bitter awakening to a sense of satiety and
      self-deception; intervals of quiet reflection, broken in upon by the
      turbulent cries of a hundred malicious spirits; weird glimpses into a
      world of phantom shapes, exaltation into the seventh heaven of delight,
      descent into the bottom pit of darkness; these were a few of the strange
      and vague, but none the less intense, emotional experiences through which
      Mrs. Lehmyl led him. When she returned to her chair, opposite his own, he
      could only look upon her face and wonder; he could not speak. A delicate
      flush had overspread her cheeks, and her eyes shone even more brightly
      than their wont. She evidently misunderstood his silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said, with frank disappointment, &ldquo;it did not please you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please me?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;No, indeed, it did not please me. It was like
      Dante&rsquo;s journey through the three realms of the dead. It was like seeing a
      miracle performed. It overpowered me. I suppose I am too susceptible&mdash;weak,
      if you will, and womanish. But such music as that&mdash;I could no more
      have withstood its spell, than I could withstand the influence of strong
      wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of strong wine,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hart, &ldquo;what if you should try a
      little mild wine?&rdquo; And she pointed to a servant who had crossed the
      threshold in the midst of Arthur&rsquo;s rhapsody, and who bore a tray with
      glasses and a decanter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of this anti-climax,&rdquo; he said, sipping his wine, &ldquo;what I said
      was the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the fault, no doubt, of your French blood, Monsieur,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Lehmyl. &ldquo;But I confess that, perhaps in a moderated degree, music has much
      the same effect upon me. When I first heard <i>La Damnation de Faust</i>,
      I had to hold on to the arms of my chair, to keep from being carried
      bodily away. You remember that dreadful ride into perdition&mdash;toward
      the end? I really felt that if I let go my anchorage, I should be swept
      off along with Faust and Mephistopheles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember. But that did not affect me so. I never was so affected till I
      heard you play just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I ought to feel complimented, or the reverse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the feeling we naturally have at perceiving our power over
      another human being?&rdquo; Mrs. Lehmyl changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was an exceedingly clever guess you made the other day,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;that I was a lover of Browning. I can&rsquo;t understand what suggested it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you then that I dared not enlighten you, lest I might be deemed
      presumptuous. If you will promise me absolution, beforehand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, too, I take for granted, share my sentiments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I have read is unsurpassed. &rsquo;The Inn Album,&rsquo; for example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And &rsquo;The Ring and the Book.&rsquo;.rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t read &rsquo;The Ring and the Book.&rsquo;.rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then you must read it at once. Then you don&rsquo;t half know Browning.
      Will you read it, if I lend it to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind. I should like nothing better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lehmyl begged to be excused and left the room. Arthur followed the
      sound of her light, quick footsteps up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Browning is her patron saint,&rdquo; volunteered Mrs. Hart. &ldquo;She spends her
      time about equally between him and her piano.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lehmyl came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said, giving him the volume, and smiling, &ldquo;there is my <i>vade
      mecum</i>. I love it almost as dearly as I could if it were a human being.
      You must be sure to like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you honor me very highly by entrusting it to me,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home he opened it, thinking to read for an hour or two before going to
      bed. What interested him, however, even more than the strong, virile,
      sympathetic poetry, and, indeed, ere long, quite absorbed his attention,
      were the traces of Mrs. Lehmyl&rsquo;s ownership that he came across every here
      and there&mdash;a corner dog-eared, a passage inclosed by pencil lines, a
      fragment of rose-petal stuck between the pages. It gave him a delicious
      sense of intimacy with her to hold this book in his hands. Had not her
      hand warmed it? her hair shadowed it? her very breath touched it? Had it
      not been her companion in solitary moments? a witness to the life she led
      when no human eye was upon her? What precious secrets it might have
      whispered, if it had had a tongue! There was a slight discoloration of the
      paper, where Pompilia tells of her miseries as Guido&rsquo;s bride. Who could
      say but that it had been caused by Mrs. Lehmyl&rsquo;s tears? That she had
      loaned him the book seemed somehow like a mark of confidence. On the
      flyleaf something had been written in ink, and subsequently scratched out&mdash;probably
      her name. He wondered why she had erased it. Toward the close of
      Caponsacchi&rsquo;s version, one of the pages had been torn clear across, and
      then neatly pasted together with tissue paper braces. He wondered what the
      circumstances were under which the mischief had been done, and whether the
      repair was her handiwork. A faint, sweet perfume clung to the pages. It
      had the power of calling her up vividly before him, and sending an
      exquisite tremor into his heart. And, withal, had any body suggested that
      he was at the verge of falling in love with her, he would have denied it
      stoutly&mdash;so little was he disposed to self-analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      But ere a great while, the scales fell from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      By dint of much self-discipline, he managed to let a week and a day elapse
      before paying his second call. While he stood in the vestibule, waiting
      for the opening of the door, sundry bursts of sound escaping from within,
      informed him that a duet was being played upon the piano. Intuitively he
      concluded that the treble part was Mrs. Lehmyl&rsquo;s; instinctively he asked,
      &ldquo;But who is carrying the bass?&rdquo; On entering the parlor, it was with a
      sharp and significant pang that he beheld, seated at Mrs. Lehmyl&rsquo;s left,
      no less redoubtable a creature than a Man. He took a chair, and sat down,
      and suffered untold wretchedness until that duet was finished. He could
      not see the man&rsquo;s face, but the back of his head indicated youth. The
      vicissitudes of the composition they were playing brought the two
      performers painfully close together. This was bad enough; but to poor
      Arthur&rsquo;s jealous mind it seemed as if from time to time, even when the
      music furnished no excuse, they voluntarily approached each other. Every
      now and then they hurriedly exchanged a whispered sentence. He felt that
      he would eagerly have bartered his ten fingers for the right to know what
      it was they said. How much satisfaction would he have obtained if he had
      been stationed near enough to overhear? All they said was, &ldquo;One, two,
      three, four, five, six.&rdquo; Perhaps in his suspicious mood he would have
      magnified this innocent remark into a confidence conveyed by means of a
      secret code.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the musicians rose Arthur experienced a slight relief. Mrs. Lehmyl
      greeted him with marked kindness, and shook hands warmly. She introduced
      her co-executant as Mr. Spencer. And Mr. Spencer was tall, lean, gawky and
      bilious-looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Arthur&rsquo;s relief was of short duration. Mr. Spencer forthwith proceeded
      to exhibit great familiarity with both of the ladies&mdash;a familiarity
      which they did not appear to resent. Mrs. Hart, indeed, reciprocated to
      the extent of addressing him as Dick. His conversation made it manifest
      that he had traveled with them in Europe. He was constantly referring to
      people and places and events about which Arthur was altogether ignorant.
      His every other sentence began: &ldquo;Do you remember?&rdquo; Arthur was excessively
      uneasy; but he had determined to sit Mr. Spencer out, though he should,
      peradventure, remain until sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Spencer did indeed remain till the night had got on its last legs. It
      lacked but a quarter of midnight when, finally, he accomplished his exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Mrs. Hart, after he had gone: &ldquo;A Boston man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We met him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lehmyl, &ldquo;at Aix-les-Bains. He&rsquo;s a remarkably
      well-informed musician&mdash;writes criticisms for one of the Boston
      papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came this evening,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Hart, &ldquo;to tell us of the happy
      termination of a love affair in which he was involved when we last saw
      him. He&rsquo;s going to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words Arthur&rsquo;s spirits shot up far above their customary level.
      So! There was no occasion for jealousy in the quarter of Mr. Spencer, at
      any rate. The reaction was so great that had Mr. Spencer still been
      present, I think our hero would have felt like hugging him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very fine fellow, I should judge,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have outstaid him
      because I wanted to tell you that Hetzel and I have devised a jolly little
      plan for Sunday, in which we are anxious to have you join us. Our idea is
      to spend the afternoon in the Metropolitan Art Museum. You know, the
      pictures are well worth an inspection; and on Sunday there is no crowd.
      Hetz has procured a Sunday ticket through the courtesy of the director.
      Then, afterward, you are to come back with us and take dinner&mdash;if the
      weather permits, out on our roof. Mrs. Berle will be at the dinner, though
      she doesn&rsquo;t care to go with us to see the pictures. We may count upon you,
      may we not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly; that will be delightful,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we will call for you at about three o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hand was hot and trembling as it clasped Mrs. Lehmyl&rsquo;s; a state of
      things which she, however, did not appear to notice. She gazed calmly into
      his eyes, and returned a quiet good-night. He stood a long while in the
      doorway of his house, looking across at No. 46. He saw the light quenched
      in the parlor, and other lights break out in the floors above. Then these
      in their turn were extinguished; and he knew that the occupants were on
      their way to the land of Nod. &ldquo;Good angels guard her slumbers,&rdquo; he said,
      half aloud, and climbed the stairs that led to his own bedchamber. There
      he lay awake hour after hour. He could hear the waters of the river
      lapping the shore, and discern the street lamps gleaming like stars along
      the opposite embankment. Now and again a tug-boat puffed importantly up
      stream&mdash;a steam whistle shrieked&mdash;a schooner glided mysteriously
      past. I don&rsquo;t know how many times he confessed to his pillow, &ldquo;I love her&mdash;I
      love her&mdash;I love her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day&mdash;Saturday&mdash;he passed in a fever of impatience. It
      seemed as though to-morrow never would arrive. At night he scarcely slept
      two hours. And on Sunday morning he was up by six o&rsquo;clock. Then, how the
      hours and minutes did prolong themselves, until the hands of his watch
      marked three!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; Hetzel asked more than once. &ldquo;Why are you so
      restless? You roam around like a cat who has lost her kittens. Any thing
      worrying you? Feeling unwell? Or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m a little nervous&mdash;guess I drank more coffee for breakfast
      than was good for me,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to read. The print blurred before his eyes. He tried to write a
      letter. He proceeded famously thus far: &ldquo;New York, May 24, 1884.&mdash;My
      dearest mother.&mdash;&rdquo; But at this point his pen stuck. Strive as he
      might, he could get no further.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tore the paper up, in a pet. He smoked thrice his usual allowance of
      tobacco. Every other minute he had out his watch. He half believed that
      Time had slackened its pace for the especial purpose of adding fuel to the
      fires that were burning in his breast. Such is the preposterous egotism of
      a man in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at length the clock struck half after two, his pulse quickened. This
      last half hour was as long as the entire forepart of the day had been.
      With each moment, his agitation increased. Finally he and Hetzel crossed
      the street. He had to bite his lips and press his finger-nails deep into
      the flesh of his hands, in order to command a tolerably self-possessed
      exterior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur says that he remembers the rest of that Sunday as one remembers a
      bewildering dream. He remembers, to begin with, how Mrs. Lehmyl met him in
      Mrs. Hart&rsquo;s drawing-room, and gave him a warm, soft hand, and spoke a few
      pleasant words of welcome. He remembers how his heart fluttered, and how
      he had to catch for breath, as he gazed into her unfathomable eyes, and
      inhaled that daintiest of perfumes which clung to her apparel. He
      remembers how he marched at her side through Fiftieth Street to Madison
      Avenue, in a state of delirious intoxication, and how they mounted a
      celestial chariot&mdash;Hetzel says it was a Madison Avenue horse car&mdash;in
      which he sat next to her, and heard her voice mingle with the tinkling of
      silver bells, like a strain of heavenly music. He remembers how they
      sauntered through the galleries, chatting together about&mdash;oddly
      enough, he can not remember what. Oddly enough, also, he can not remember
      the pictures that they looked at. He can remember only &ldquo;the angelic
      radiance of her face and the wonderful witchery of her presence.&rdquo; Then he
      remembers how they walked home together through the Park, green and
      fragrant in the gentle May weather, and took places side by side at the
      table on the roof. &ldquo;What is strangest,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is this, that I do not
      remember any thing at all about the other people who were present&mdash;Hetzel
      and Mrs. Berle and Mrs. Hart. As I look back, it seems as though she and I
      had been alone with each other the whole time.&rdquo; &ldquo;But we were there,
      nevertheless,&rdquo; Hetzel assures me; &ldquo;and one of us enjoyed hugely witnessing
      his young friend&rsquo;s infatuation. It was delightful to see the big,
      stalwart, imperious Arthur Ripley, helpless as a baby in the power of that
      little woman. One not well acquainted with him might not have perceived
      his condition; but to me it was as plain as the nose on his face.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;There
      was a full moon that evening,&rdquo; Arthur continues, &ldquo;and I wish you could
      have seen her eyes in the moonlight. I kept thinking of the old song,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;In thy dark eyes splendor,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Where the warm light loves to dwell.&rsquo;.rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you&rsquo;ll think me sentimental, but I can&rsquo;t help it. The fact is
      that those eyes of hers glowed with all the tenderness and pathos and
      mystery of a martyr&rsquo;s. Pale, ethereal fires burned deep down in them, and
      showed where her soul dwelt. They haunted me for days afterward. Days? No&mdash;months.
      They haunt me now. My heart thrills at this moment, thinking of them, just
      as it did then, when I was looking into them. I tell you it hurt here&rdquo;&mdash;thumping
      his chest&mdash;&ldquo;when I had to part with her. It was like&mdash;yes, sir;
      you needn&rsquo;t smile&mdash;it was like having my heart wrenched out. My
      senses were in confusion. I walked up and down my floor pretty much all
      night. You never saw such a wretched fellow. At least I fancied I was
      wretched. The thought of how hopeless my case was&mdash;of how unlikely it
      was that she would ever care a farthing for me&mdash;drove me about
      frantic. All the same, I wouldn&rsquo;t have exchanged that wretchedness for all
      the other treasures of the world.&rdquo; In this exaggerated vein, he would
      gladly babble on for the next twenty pages; but to what profit, since it
      is already clear that he was head-over-ears in love?
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Arthur had no idea of making a declaration. That she should
      cherish for him a feeling at all of the nature of his for her, seemed the
      most improbable of contingencies. So long as he could retain the privilege
      of seeing her frequently, he would be contented; he would not run the risk
      of having it withdrawn by revealing to her a condition of affairs which,
      very likely, she would not sanction. His supremest aspiration, he derived
      a certain dismal satisfaction from fancying, would be realized if he could
      in some way become useful and helpful to her, no matter after how lowly a
      fashion. Henceforward he spent at least one evening a week in her company.
      &rsquo;She never received him alone; but Mrs. Hart&rsquo;s presence was not
      objectionable, because she had the sensible custom of knitting in silence,
      and leaving the two younger folks to do the talking. Their talk was
      generally about music and literature and other edifying themes; rarely
      about matters personal. Arthur got pretty well acquainted with Mrs.
      Lehmyl&rsquo;s views and tastes and habits of thought; but when he stopped to
      reckon up how much he had gathered concerning herself, her family
      connections, her life in the past, he acknowledged that it could all be
      represented by a solitary nought. Not that she was conspicuously reserved
      with him. She made it unmistakably evident that she liked him cordially.
      Only, the pronouns, I and thou, played a decidedly minor part in her
      ordinary conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He experienced all the pains and pleasures of first love, and all the
      strange hallucinations that it produces. The man who looks at the world
      through a lover&rsquo;s eyes, is as badly off as he who looks at it through a
      distorting lens&mdash;objects are thrown out of their proper relations;
      proportion and perspective go mad; big things become little, and <i>vice
      versa</i>. Especially is it remarkable how completely his notions of time
      will get perverted. For instance, the hours flew by with a rapidity
      positively astounding when Arthur was in Mrs. Lehmyl&rsquo;s presence. He would
      sit down opposite her at eight o clock; they would converse for a few
      moments; she would sing a song or two; and then, to his unutterable
      stupefaction, the clock would strike eleven! On the other hand, when he
      was away from her, time lagged in an equally perplexing manner. He and
      Hetzel, to illustrate, would finish their dinner at half past seven&mdash;only
      a half hour before he would be at liberty to cross the street. But that
      half hour! It stretched out like an eternity, beyond the reach of Arthur&rsquo;s
      imagination. Life had changed to a dream or to a delirium&mdash;it would
      be hard to say which. The laws of cause and effect had ceased to operate.
      The universe had lost its equilibrium. Arthur&rsquo;s heart would swing from hot
      to cold, from cold to hot, without a pretense of physiological rhyme or
      reason. He became moody and capricious. A fiber in his composition, the
      existence of which he had never hitherto suspected, acquired an alarming
      prominence. That was an almost womanish sensitiveness. It was as if he had
      been stripped of his armor. Small things, trifling events, that had in the
      past left him entirely unimpressed, now smote his consciousness like
      sharpened arrows. Sights of distress in the streets, stories of suffering
      in the newspapers, moved him keenly and profoundly. He had been reading <i>Wilhelm
      Meisler</i>. He could not finish it. The emotions it occasioned him were
      poignant enough to border upon physical pain. The long and short of it is
      that Love had turned his rose-tinted calcium light upon the world in which
      Arthur moved, and so made visible a myriad beauties and blemishes that had
      lain hidden in the darkness heretofore. Among other things that Arthur
      remarked as curious, was the frequency with which he saw her name, Lehmyl,
      or other names resembling it, Lemyhl, Lehmil, etc., on sign-boards, as he
      was being whirled through the streets on the elevated railway. He was sure
      that he had never seen it or heard it till she had come to dwell in
      Beekman Place. Now he was seeing it all the time. He was disposed to be
      somewhat superstitious anent this circumstance, to regard it as an omen of
      some sort&mdash;but whether for good or evil, he could not tell. Of course
      its explanation was simple enough. With the name uppermost in his mind, it
      was natural that his attention should be caught by it wherever it
      occurred; whereas formerly, before he had known her, it was one of a
      hundred names that he had passed unnoticed every day. And yet, emerging
      from a brown study of which she had been the subject, it was a little
      startling to look out of the window, and find Lehmyl staring him in the
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then, if the weather was fine, he would go up-town early and
      accompany her for a walk in Central Park. Occasionally he would tuck a
      book into his pocket, so that when they sat down to rest he could read
      aloud to her. One day the book of his selection chanced to be a volume of
      Nathaniel Hawthorne&rsquo;s shorter tales. They had appropriated unto themselves
      a bench in a secluded alley; and now Arthur opened to &ldquo;The Snow Image.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But before he had proceeded beyond the second sentence, Mrs. Lehmyl
      stopped him. &ldquo;Oh, please&mdash;please don&rsquo;t read that,&rdquo; she cried, in a
      sharp, startled tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur looked up. He saw that her face had turned deathly pale, that her
      lips were quivering, and that her eyes had moistened. Thrusting the book
      into his pocket, he stammered out a few hasty words of anxiety. She was
      not ill?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;not ill. Only, when you began to read that story&mdash;when
      I realized what it was that you were reading&mdash;I&mdash;it&mdash;it
      recalled disagreeable memories. But&mdash;shall we walk on?&rdquo; She was
      silent or monosyllabic, and her face wore a grave expression, all the rest
      of their time together. At the door of her house she gave him her hand,
      and looked straight into his eyes, and said, &ldquo;You must forgive me if I
      have spoiled your afternoon. I could not help it. You know how it is&rsquo; when
      one is happy&mdash;very happy&mdash;to be reminded suddenly of things one
      would like to forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur&rsquo;s heart went out to her in a mighty bound. &ldquo;When one is happy&mdash;very
      happy!&rdquo; The phrase echoed like a peal of gala bells in his ears. He had a
      hard struggle to keep from flinging himself at her feet there in the open
      street. But all his love burned in the glance he gave her&mdash;an
      intense, radiant glance, which she met with one that threw his soul into a
      transport. She knew now that he loved her! There could be no doubt about
      that. And, since her eyes did not quail before his&mdash;since she had
      sustained unflinchingly the gaze which, more eloquently than any words,
      told her of the passion that was consuming him&mdash;might he not conclude&mdash;?
      Ah, no; he would trust himself to conclude nothing till he had spoken with
      her by word of mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May&mdash;may I call upon you to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He relinquished her hand, which he had been clinging to all this time, and
      went his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When one is happy&mdash;very happy,&rdquo; he repeated again and again. &ldquo;So she
      was happy&mdash;very happy!&mdash;until I opened that ill-fated book. What
      can the associations be that darkened her mood so abruptly? But <i>to-morrow!</i>&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;&ldquo;THE WOMAN WHO HESITATES.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      RIPLEY, attorney, New York:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draft accepted. Begin immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ulrich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>uch was the cable
      dispatch that Arthur got a fortnight after he had mailed his letter to
      Counselor Ulrich of Vienna. A fortnight later still, the post brought him
      an epistle to the same effect. Then ensued four weeks of silence. During
      these four weeks one question had received a good share of his attention.
      The substance and the solution of it, may be gathered from the following
      conversation held between him and Peixada.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur said, &ldquo;Suppose the residence of your sister-in-law to be
      discovered: what next? Suppose we find that she is living in Europe: how
      can we induce her to return hither and render herself liable to the
      jurisdiction of our courts? Or suppose even that she should turn out to be
      established here in New York: what&rsquo;s to prevent her from packing her
      trunks and taking French leave the day after citations to attend the
      probate of her husband&rsquo;s will are served upon her? In other words, how are
      we to compel her to stand and deliver? Ignorant as we are of the nature
      and location of her properties, we can&rsquo;t attach them in the regular way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peixada said, &ldquo;Hum! That&rsquo;s so. I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that. That&rsquo;s a pretty
      serious question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;it struck me as more than serious&mdash;as
      fatal. But there&rsquo;s a way out of it&mdash;the neatest and simplest way you
      can imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; sighed Peixada, with manifest relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now see,&rdquo; continued Arthur. &ldquo;Mrs. Peixada shot her husband&mdash;was
      indicted&mdash;tried&mdash;acquitted&rsquo;&mdash;yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But at the same time she also took the life of a man named Edward Bolen,
      her husband&rsquo;s coachman&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did&mdash;certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she indicted for his murder as well as for the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was indicted, yes, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But never arraigned for trial. Then the indictment is still in force
      against her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is&mdash;unless the statute of limitations&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The statute of limitations does not apply after an indictment has once
      been found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was thinking the matter over the other day&mdash;confronting that
      difficulty I have mentioned, and wondering how the mischief it was to be
      surmounted&mdash;when it occurred to me that it might be possible to
      interest the authorities in our behalf, and so get Mrs. Peixada under lock
      and key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went over to the district-attorney&rsquo;s office, and saw Mr. Romer, the
      senior assistant, who happens to be a good friend of mine, and told him
      the sum and substance of our case. Then I asked him whether for the sake
      of justice he wouldn&rsquo;t lend us the machinery of the law&mdash;that is,
      upon our finding out her whereabouts, cause her extradition and
      imprisonment under the indictment <i>in re</i> Bolen. I promised that you
      would assume the entire expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he replied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it was a rather irregular proposition, but that he would think it
      over and let me know his conclusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you heard from him since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yesterday morning I received a note, asking me to call at his
      office. When I got there, this is what he said. He said that he had read
      the indictment, and consulted his chief, Mr. Orson, and pondered the
      matter pretty thoroughly. Extraordinary as the proceeding would be, he had
      decided to do as I wished. &rsquo;Because,&rsquo; he added, &rsquo;there&rsquo;s a mighty strong
      case against the woman, and I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it would be worth our
      while to try her. At any rate, if you can set us on her track, we&rsquo;ll
      arrest her and take our chances. We&rsquo;ve made quite a point, you know, of
      unearthing indictments that our predecessors had pigeonholed; and more
      than once we&rsquo;ve secured a conviction. It doesn&rsquo;t follow that because the
      jury in the Peixada case stultified themselves, another jury will. So, you
      go ahead with your inquiries; and when she&rsquo;s firmly pinned down, we&rsquo;ll
      take her in custody. Then, after you&rsquo;ve recovered your money, we can step
      in and do our best to send her up to Sing Sing.&rsquo;&mdash;I declare, I was
      half sorry to have prepared new troubles for the poor creature; but, you
      see, our interests are now perfectly protected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A brilliant stroke!&rdquo; cried Peixada. &ldquo;Then we shall not merely rescue my
      brother&rsquo;s property, but, indirectly at least, we shall avenge his death! I
      am delighted. Now we must redouble our efforts to ferret her out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. And that brings me to another point. I have had a long letter&mdash;sixteen
      solid pages&mdash;from Ulrich, the Austrian lawyer. He has traced her from
      Vienna to Paris, from Paris to London. He&rsquo;s in London now, working up his
      clew. The last news of her dates back to May, 1882. On the 23d of that
      month she left the hotel she had been stopping at in London, and went&mdash;Ulrich
      is trying to discover where. I think our best course now will be to retain
      an English solicitor, and let him carry the matter on from the point
      Ulrich has reached. With your approval, I shall cable Ulrich to put the
      affair into the hands of Mr. Reginald Graham, a London attorney in whom I
      have the utmost confidence. What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re right. No doubt about that. Meantime, here.&rdquo;&mdash;Peixada
      handed his legal adviser a check for one hundred dollars. &ldquo;This is to keep
      up your spirits,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above conference had taken place on the forenoon of Wednesday, the
      25th of June. It was on that afternoon that Arthur started to read &ldquo;The
      Snow Image&rdquo; to Mrs. Lehmyl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, after an eternity of impatience, he rang her bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Lehmyl,&rdquo; said the servant, &ldquo;is sick in her room with a headache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Arthur, and stood still, gaping for dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; repeated Bridget; &ldquo;sick in her room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but she will receive me. I call by appointment. Please tell her that
      I am here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said that she could receive no one; but if you&rsquo;ll step into the
      parlor, I&rsquo;ll speak to Mrs. Hart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart appeared and corroborated the maid&rsquo;s statement. A big lump
      gathered in Arthur&rsquo;s throat. He had looked forward so eagerly to this
      moment&mdash;had hoped so much from it&mdash;and it had been such a long
      time coming&mdash;that now to have it slip away unused, like this&mdash;the
      disappointment was bitter. He felt utterly miserable and dejected. As he
      dragged himself down the stoop&mdash;he had sprung up it, two steps at a
      stride, a moment since&mdash;he noticed a group of urchins, standing on
      the curbstone and grinning from ear to ear. He fancied that they had
      guessed his secret, and were laughing at his discomfiture; if he had
      obeyed his impulse, he would have wrung their necks on the spot. He
      crossed the street, locked himself in his room, and surrendered
      unresistingly to the blue devils.
    </p>
    <p>
      These vivacious sprites played fast and loose with the poor boy&rsquo;s
      imagination. They conjured up before him a multitude of unlikely
      catastrophes. They persuaded him that his case was worse than hopeless.
      Mrs. Lehmyl cared not a fig for him. Why, forsooth, should she? Probably
      he had a successful rival. That a woman such as she should love an
      insignificant young fellow like himself&mdash;the bare idea was
      preposterous. He was to blame for having allowed the flower of hope to
      take root in his bosom. He laughed bitterly, and wondered how he had
      contrived to deceive himself even for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was trebly absurd that she should love him after so brief and so
      superficial an acquaintance. Life wasn&rsquo;t worth living; and, but for his
      mother and Hetzel, he would put an end to himself forthwith. Yet, the next
      instant he was recalling the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; that she had spoken yesterday, in
      response to his &ldquo;May I call to-morrow?&rdquo; and the fearless glance with which
      she had met his eyes. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;it set my blood afire. It dazzled
      me with visions of impossible joy. I could almost hear her murmur&mdash;oh,
      so softly&mdash;&rsquo;I love you, Arthur!&rsquo; You may guess the effect that fancy
      had upon me.&rdquo; It is significant that not once did he pity her for her
      headache. He took for granted that it was merely a subterfuge for
      refusing&rsquo; to receive him. But her motive for refusing to see him&mdash;
      There was the rub! If he could only have divined it&mdash;known it to a
      certainty&mdash;then his suspense would have been less of an agony, then
      his mind could have borrowed some repose, though perhaps the repose of
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he got through the night after a fashion. A streak of cold, gray
      light lay along the eastern horizon, and the river had put off the color
      of ink for the color of lead, before he fell asleep. His sleep was
      troubled. A nightmare played frightful antics upon his breast. It was
      broad day when he awoke. The river sparkled gayly in the sunlight, the sky
      shimmered with warmth, the sparrows outside quarreled vociferously. A
      brief glow of cheerfulness was the result. But memory speedily asserted
      itself. Heartsick and weary he began his toilet. &ldquo;What had I to look
      forward to?&rdquo; he demands. He climbed the staircase, and entered the
      breakfast room. Hetzel sat near the window, reading a newspaper. Hetzel
      grunted forth a gruff good-morning, without looking up. I doubt however,
      whether Arthur knew that Hetzel was there at all. For, as he crossed the
      threshold, his eye was caught by something white lying upon his plate. He
      can&rsquo;t tell why&mdash;but he guessed at once that it was a note from Mrs.
      Lehmyl. His lover&rsquo;s instinct scented the truth from afar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He snatched the letter up eagerly. But he delayed about opening it. He
      scrutinized the direction&mdash;written in a frank, firm, woman&rsquo;s hand.
      The paper exhaled never so faint a perfume. Still he did not open it. He
      was afraid. He would wait till his agitation had subsided a little. He
      could hear his heart going thump, thump, thump, like a hammer against his
      side. He had difficulty with his breath. Then a dreadful possibility
      loomed up before him! What&mdash;what if it should not be from her after
      all! This thought endowed him with the courage of desperation. He tore the
      missive open.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was standing there, one hand grasping the back of his chair, the other
      holding the letter to his eyes, when Hetzel, throwing his newspaper aside,
      got up, turned about the room, then abruptly came to a halt, facing
      Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy upon me, man,&rdquo; cried Hetzel, &ldquo;what has happened? Cheeks burning,
      fingers trembling! No bad news? Speak&mdash;quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Arthur did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel went on: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed lately, there&rsquo;s been something wrong with
      you. You&rsquo;re nervous, restless, out of kilter. Is there a woman in the
      case? Is your feeling for our neighbor something more than a passing
      fancy? Are you taking her seriously? Or, are you simply run down-+-in need
      of rest and change? Why not make a trip up to Oldbridge, and see your
      mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time Hetzel had finished speaking, Arthur had folded his letter and
      stowed it away in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? What were you saying?&rdquo; he inquired, with a blank look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I was saying that breakfast is getting cold; coffee spoiling, biscuit
      drying up&mdash;whatever you choose. Letter from home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home? No; not from home,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, draw up, anyhow. Is&mdash;is&mdash;By Jove, what is the matter with
      you? Where are you now? Why don&rsquo;t you pay attention when I speak? What has
      come over you the last week or two? You&rsquo;re worrying me to death. Out with
      it! No secrets from the head of the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no secrets,&rdquo; Arthur answered, meekly; &ldquo;only&mdash;only, if you
      must know it, I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo; No doubt he was on the point of making a full
      confession. He restrained himself, however; added, &ldquo;There! I won&rsquo;t talk
      about it;&rdquo; applied himself to his knife and fork, and preserved a dismal
      silence till the end of the meal. He went away as soon as ordinary
      courtesy would warrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had he closed the door behind him, than his hand made a dive
      into his pocket, and brought out Mrs. Lehmyl&rsquo;s letter. He read it through
      for perhaps the twentieth time. It ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;46 Beekman Place,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thursday evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Mr. Ripley After a sleepless night, my head is aching cruelly. That
      is why I was unable to receive you. But, since you had told me that you
      were coming, I feel that I must write this note to explain and to
      apologize. I should have sent you word not to come, except that until now
      I have been too ill to use my eyes. The only help for me when I have a
      headache like this, is solitary confinement in a darkened room. I have
      braved the gaslight for an instant, to write you this note, and already I
      am suffering the consequences. But I felt that I really owed you my
      excuses. You will accept them in a lenient spirit, will you not?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sincerely yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth Lehmyl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I think Arthur&rsquo;s first sentiment on reading this communication, had been
      one of disappointment. It was just such an apology as she might have
      written to anybody else under similar circumstances. He had nerved
      himself, he thought, for the worst before breaking the seal&mdash;for a
      decree forbidding him future admittance to her presence, for an
      announcement of her betrothal to another man&mdash;for what not. But a
      quite colorless, polite, and amiable &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he had not
      contemplated. It produced the effect of a wet blanket. From the high and
      mighty heroic mood in which he had torn it open, to the unimpassioned
      sentences in which it was couched, was too rapid a transition, too abrupt
      a plunge from hot to cold, an anti-climax equally unexpected and
      depressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after a second perusal&mdash;and a second perusal followed immediately
      upon the first&mdash;his pulse quickened. With a lover&rsquo;s swift faculty for
      seizing hold of and interpreting trifles light as air, he discerned what
      he believed to be encouraging tokens. Under what obligation had Mrs.
      Lehmyl been to write to him so promptly? At the cost of severe pain, she
      had hastened to make her excuses for a thing that there was not really the
      least hurry about. If she were quite indifferent to him, would she not
      have deferred writing until her headache had passed off? To be sure, it
      was just such a note as she might have written to Brown, Jones, or
      Robinson; but would she have &ldquo;braved the gaslight&rdquo; and &ldquo;suffered the
      consequences&rdquo; for Brown, Jones, or Robinson? Obviously, she had felt a
      strong desire to set herself right with him; the recognition of which fact
      afforded Arthur no end of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time he had committed Mrs. Lehmyl&rsquo;s note to memory, he was in a
      fair way to recover his wonted buoyancy of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course he rang her door-bell in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Mrs. Lehmyl to-day?&rdquo; he inquired of the maid. &ldquo;I hope her headache
      is better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s all well again to-day&mdash;just the same as ever,&rdquo; was the
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      An idea occurred to him. He had intended merely to inform himself
      concerning her health, leave the bunch of flowers he held in his right
      hand, and go his way. But if she was up and about, why not ask to see her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;is she in?&rdquo; he questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; she&rsquo;s in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please give her my card, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked into the parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parlor was darkened&mdash;blinds closed to exclude the heat&mdash;and
      intensely still. The ticking of the clock on the mantel-piece was the only
      interruption of the silence, save when at intervals the distant roar of a
      train on the elevated railway became audible for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lehmyl entered, and gave him her hand, and looked up smiling at him,
      all without a word. She wore a white gown, and an amber necklace and
      bracelet; and my informant says that she had &ldquo;a halo of sweetness and
      purity all around her.&rdquo; For a trice Arthur was tongue-tied.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, &ldquo;I have brought you a few flowers,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the flowers, and buried her nose in them, and thanked their
      donor, and pinned one of the roses at her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are quite well again,&rdquo; he pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very thoughtful of you to write me that letter&mdash;when you were
      in such pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I owed it to you. I had promised to receive you. It would have been
      unfair, if I had not written.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I was quite alarmed about you. I was afraid your headache might&mdash;&rdquo;
       He faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no occasion for alarm. I am used to such headaches. I expect
      one every now and then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;do you know?&mdash;at first I did not believe in it&mdash;not
      until your letter confirmed what Mrs. Hart and the servant had said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought perhaps&mdash;perhaps you did not care to see me, and had
      pleaded a headache for politeness&rsquo; sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did me an injustice.&rdquo;&mdash;A pause.&mdash;&ldquo;I did care to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A longer pause. Arthur&rsquo;s heart was beating madly. Well it might. She had
      pronounced the last sentence with an emphasis calculated to move a man
      less deeply in love than he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean what you have just said?&rdquo; he asked presently. His voice
      quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you knew&mdash;I&mdash;I suppose you knew what it was I wanted
      to say to you&mdash;what it was I would have said, if I had been
      admitted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I knew,&rdquo; she answered, in almost a whisper, and bowed her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur sprang toward her and grasped her hand. &ldquo;You knew&mdash;then, you
      know that&mdash;that I love you&mdash;<i>Ruth!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She withdrew her hand, but did not raise her head. He waited for a moment,
      breathless; then, &ldquo;Ah, speak to me&mdash;won&rsquo;t you speak to me?&rdquo; he
      begged, piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head now, and gazed into his eyes; but her gaze was not one
      of gladness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, alas, alas, I know it,&rdquo; she said, very slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur started back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, alas?&rdquo; he repeated after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she said, in the same slow, grave way; &ldquo;it is very, very sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sad?&rdquo; His eyes were full of mystification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that it is sad that you should care for me. If I had only foreseen
      it&mdash;but I did not. You knew so little of me, how could I foresee? But
      on Wednesday&mdash;the way you looked at me&mdash;oh, forgive me. I&mdash;I
      never meant to make you care for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; said Arthur, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why I wanted to see you. After what passed on Wednesday, I felt
      that it was best for us both that I should see you and tell you what a
      mistake you had made. I wanted to tell you that you must try hard to
      forget about it. It would be useless and cruel for me to pretend not to
      have understood, when you looked at me so. It was best that we should meet
      again, and that I should explain it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your explanation puts me in the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not want to love a woman unless there was hope that some day
      you might marry her. Would not that be a great unhappiness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a question of <i>want</i>. I should love you under any and all
      conditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you never, never can marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not believe it until&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait. Do not say things that you may wish to unsay a moment hence. You
      never can marry me, for one sufficient reason&mdash;because&mdash;&rdquo; She
      hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because?&rdquo; There was panic in Arthur&rsquo;s heart. Was she not a widow, after
      all?
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a deep breath, and bit her lip. Her cheek had been pale. Now a
      hot blush suffused it. With an air of summoning her utmost strength, she
      went on, &ldquo;You never can marry me, because you never would marry me&mdash;never,
      unless I should tell you&mdash;something&mdash;something about my life&mdash;my
      life in the past&mdash;which I can never tell&mdash;not even to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Arthur, with manifest relief. &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is enough&mdash;it is final, fatal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I thought it might be worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There befell a silence. Arthur was mustering his forces, to get them under
      control.. He dared not speak till he had done this. At last, struggling
      hard to be calm, he said, &ldquo;Do you suppose I care any thing about your past
      life? Do you suppose that my love for you is so mean and so small as that?
      I know all that it is needful for me to know about your past. I know <i>you</i>,
      do I not? I know, then, that every act, every thought, every breath of
      your life, has been as pure and as beautiful as you are yourself. But what
      I know best, and what it is most essential for me to know, is this, Ruth,
      that I love you. I <i>love you!</i> I can not see that what you have
      spoken of is a bar to our marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but I&mdash;I would not let you enter blindfold into a union which
      some time you might repent. Should I be worthy of your love, if I would?
      But, what is worse, were I&mdash;were I to tell you this thing&mdash;which
      I can not tell you&mdash;then you&mdash;you would not ask me to marry you.
      Then you would not love me. The truth&mdash;the truth which, if I should
      become your wife, I could never share with you&mdash;which would remain
      forever a secret kept by me from my husband&mdash;it is&mdash;you would
      abhor me if you should find it out. If you should find it out after we
      were married&mdash;if somebody should come to you and tell you&mdash;oh,
      you would hate me. It is far more dreadful than you can fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no; for I will fancy the worst, and still beg of you to become
      my wife. If I loved you less&mdash;if I did not know you so well&mdash;the
      hints you utter might prompt some horrible suspicion in my mind. Will you
      take it as a proof of my love, that I dare assert positively, confidently,
      this?&mdash;Whatever the past may have been, so far as you were concerned
      in shaping it, it was good beyond reproach. Whatever your secret may be,
      it is not a secret that could show you to be one jot or tittle less noble
      than I know you to be. Whatever the truth you speak of is, it is a truth
      which, if it were understood in its entirety, would only serve to shed new
      luster upon the whiteness of your soul. And should I&mdash;should I by
      accident ever find it out&mdash;and should its form seem, as you have
      said, dreadful to me&mdash;why, I should say to myself, &rsquo;You have not
      pierced its substance? You do not understand it. However it may appear to
      you, you know that your wife&rsquo;s part in it was the part of a good angel
      from first to last 1&rsquo;&mdash;Now do you think I love you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if&mdash;if you should find out that I had been guilty of sin&mdash;do
      you mean to say that&mdash;that you would care for me in spite of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to say that I love you. I mean to say that no power under heaven
      can destroy my love of you. I mean to say that no power under heaven can
      prevent my marrying you, if you love me. I mean to say that my heart and
      soul&mdash;the \ inmost life of me&mdash;are already married to you, and
      that they will remain inseparably bound to you&mdash;<i>to you!</i>&mdash;until
      I die. More than this I mean to say. You speak of sin. You sin, forsooth!
      Well, talk of sin, if you like. Tell me that you have been guilty of&mdash;of
      what you will&mdash;of the blackest crimes in the calendar. I will not
      believe it. I will not believe that you were answerable for it. I will
      tell you that it was not your fault. I will tell you that if your hand has
      ever done any human being wrong, it was some other will than your own that
      compelled it. For this I know&mdash;I know it as I know that fire burns,
      that light illuminates&mdash;I know that you, the true, intrinsic you,
      have always been as sweet and undefiled as&mdash;as the breath that
      escapes now from your lips. There are some things that can not be&mdash;that
      no man could believe, though he beheld them with his open eyes. Can a
      circle be square? Can black be white? No man, knowing you as I know you,
      could believe that you in your soul were capable of sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had spoken with immense fervor, consuming her the while with his eyes,
      and wrenching the hand he held until it must have ached in every bone.
      She, again as pale as death, had trembled under his fierce, hot utterance,
      like a reed in the wind. But now that he had done, she seemed to recover
      herself. She withdrew her hand from his, and moved her chair away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ripley,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;you must not speak to me like this. It was not
      to hear you speak like this that I wished to see you to-day. You make it
      very hard for me to say what I have to say&mdash;what it was hard enough
      to say, at the best. But I must say it, and you must listen and
      understand. You have not understood yet. Now, please try to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed her hand to her throat, and swallowed convulsively. It was
      evident that she was nerving herself to the performance of a most painful
      task. Finally she went on, &ldquo;I have told you frankly that I understood the
      other day&mdash;understood what you meant when you looked at me that way.
      After you were gone, I thought it all over&mdash;all that I had learned. I
      thought at first that the only thing for me to do would be never to see
      you again&mdash;to refuse to receive you when you called&mdash;to avoid
      you as much as I possibly could. That, I thought, would be the best thing
      to do. But then I thought further about it, and then it seemed that that
      would not be right. To break off in that sudden way with you, and not to
      explain it, would be wrong and cruel. So I put aside that first thought,
      and said, &rsquo;No, I will not refuse to receive him. I will receive him just
      as before. Only I will act in such a manner toward him that he will not
      say any thing about caring for me. I will act so as to prevent him from
      saying any thing about that. Then we will go on and be friends the same as
      ever.&rsquo; But by and by that did not seem right either. It would be as cruel
      as the other, because, if you really did care for me, it would be a long
      suspense, a long agony for you; and perhaps, if nothing were said about
      it, you might get to caring still more for me, and might allow yourself to
      cherish false hopes, hopes that could never come true. So I decided that
      this course was as far from right as the first one. And, besides, I
      distrusted my own power&mdash;my power to keep you from speaking. It would
      be a long, long battle. I doubted whether I should have the strength to
      carry it through&mdash;always to be on my guard, and prevent you from
      speaking. &rsquo;No,&rsquo; I said, &rsquo;it is bound to come. Sooner or later, if we go on
      seeing each other, he will surely speak. Is it not better that I should
      let him know at once&mdash;what waiting will make harder for him to hear
      and for me to tell him&mdash;that I can never become his wife? Then, when
      he knows that he has made a mistake in caring for me, then he will go
      away, and think of other things, and see other women, and perhaps, by and
      by, get over it, and forget about me.&rsquo; I knew that if I told you that it
      was impossible for us to get married, and why it was impossible, I knew
      that you would give up hoping; and I thought that this course was the best
      of all. It was very hard. I shrank from the idea of speaking to you as I
      have done. Your good opinion is very precious to me. It was hard to
      persuade myself to say things to you that would, perhaps, make you think
      differently of me. But I felt that it was best. I had no right to
      procrastinate&mdash;to let you go on caring for me, and hoping for what
      could never be. Then I decided that I would see you and tell you about it
      right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused and breathed deeply; but before Arthur had had time to put in a
      word, she resumed: &ldquo;I do not believe that you have meant to make it more
      difficult for me to-day than it had to be; but it has pained me very much
      to hear you speak as you have spoken. You have not understood; but now you
      understand&mdash;must understand. I never can be your wife. You must try
      to get over caring for me. You must go away, now that I have explained,
      and never come any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had said all this in a low tone, though each syllable had been fraught
      with earnestness, and had manifestly cost an effort. Arthur, during the
      last few sentences, had been pacing up and down the room. Now he came to a
      standstill before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you mean to say,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;that that is your last word, your
      ultimatum? Do you mean to say that you will send me away&mdash;banish me
      from your presence&mdash;forbid me the happiness of seeing you and hearing
      you&mdash;all for a mere paltry nothing? If there were a real impediment
      to our marriage, I should be the first to acknowledge it, to bow before
      it. But this thing that you have mentioned&mdash;this&mdash;well, call it
      a secret, if you will&mdash;is this empty memory to rise up as a barrier
      between your life and mine? Oh, no, no! You have spoken of cruelty&mdash;you
      have wished not to be cruel. And yet this utmost cruelty you seem willing
      to perpetrate in cold blood. Stop, think, reflect upon what you are doing!
      Have you not seen how much I love you? how my whole life is in my love of
      you? Do you not know that what you propose to do&mdash;to send me away,
      all on account of this miserable secret&mdash;is to break my life forever?
      is to put out the light forever from my sky, and turn my world to a waste
      of dust and ashes? Can you&mdash;you who recoil from cruelty&mdash;be as
      wantonly cruel as this? Have I not told you that I care nothing for your
      secret, that I shall never think of your secret, if you will only speak
      one word? Oh, it is not possible that you can deliberately break my heart,
      for a mere dead thing like that! If it were something actual, something
      substantial, something existing now and here, it would be different. Then
      I, too, should recognize the size and the weight of it. I should accept
      the inevitable, and resign myself as best I could. But a bygone, a thing
      that is past and done with, how can you let that stand between us? I can
      never resign myself to that. Can&rsquo;t you imagine the torture of my position?
      To want a thing with all my soul, to know that there is no earthly reason
      why I should not have it, and yet to know that I can not have it&mdash;why,
      it is like being defeated by a soap bubble, a vapor. Of what use is all
      this talk? We are merely confusing each other, merely beating about the
      bush. I have told you what you did not expect to hear. You thought that I
      would be swerved from my purpose when you said that you had a secret. You
      thought I would go away, satisfied that it was best for us not to marry.
      But, you see, you did yourself an injustice. You did not guess the real
      depth of the love you had inspired. You see, I love you too much to care
      about the past. Confess that you did not consider this, when, you made up
      your mind to send me away. But this talk is of no use. All the talk in the
      world can not alter the way we stand. Here are the simple facts: I love
      you. <i>I love you!</i> I ask you to be my wife. I kneel down before you,
      and take your hand in mine, and beg of you not to spurn my love&mdash;not
      to be guided by a blind, deluded conscience&mdash;not to think of the past&mdash;but
      to think only of the present and the future&mdash;to think only of how
      much I love you&mdash;of how all the happiness of my life is now at stake,
      for you to make or to destroy. I ask you to be merciful. I ask you to look
      into your heart, and let that prompt you how to act. If there is one atom
      of love for me in it&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off sharply; drew a quick, hard breath. Something&mdash;a sudden,
      furtive gleam far down in her eyes&mdash;a swift coming and going of color
      to and from her cheek&mdash;caused his heart to throb with an exultant
      thrill, that for an instant deprived him of the power of speech. Then, all
      at once, &ldquo;Oh, my God! You do love me. <i>You do love me!</i>&rdquo; he cried. He
      caught her in his arms, and strained her rapturously to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she did not resist. Her face lay for a moment buried upon his
      shoulder. It was a supreme moment of silence. Then she broke away. There
      were tears in her eyes. She sobbed out, &ldquo;It is wrong, all wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Arthur knew that he had gained the day. Her first sign of weakness was
      his assurance of success. Protest now as she might, she could no longer
      hide her love from him. And if she loved him, what had he to fear? There
      was much further talk between them. She tried to regain the ground she had
      lost. Failing in this, she wept, and spoke of the wrong she had done him,
      and said that she had forfeited her self-respect. But Arthur summoned all
      his eloquence to induce her to look at the matter through his eyes, and in
      the end&mdash;Somewhat later an eavesdropper outside the parlor door might
      have caught the following dialogue passing within:
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;It is strange, Arthur, but a little while ago it seemed to
      me that I could never tell that&mdash;that thing&mdash;I spoke about, to
      any living soul; yet now&mdash;now I feel quite otherwise. I feel as
      though I could tell it to you. I want to tell it to you. It is only right
      that I should tell you every thing about my life. It is a long story;
      shall I begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;No, Ruth. Shall I let the happiness of this hour be
      marred for you and me, by your thinking and speaking of what would pain
      you? Besides, I prefer that you should keep this&mdash;this thing&mdash;this
      secret&mdash;as an evidence of my unwavering confidence in you. Why should
      we trouble ourselves about the past at all, when the present is at hand,
      and the future is waiting for us? You and I&mdash;we have only just been
      born. The past is dead. Our life dates from this moment. Oh, it is to the
      future that we must look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it seems as though you ought to know&mdash;ought to know your wife&mdash;ought
      to know who she is, and what she has done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do know her. I do know who she is and what she has done. I know it
      all by instinct. I want her to have this constant proof of my love&mdash;that
      I can trust her without, learning her secrets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will not forget&mdash;never forget&mdash;that I have offered to
      tell you, will you? You will remember that I am always willing to tell you&mdash;that
      whenever you wish to know it, you will only have to ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will remember it; and it will make me happy to remember it. But if
      you wish to tell me something now that I should like to hear, tell me on
      what day we shall be married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is too soon to fix that&mdash;we can wait about fixing that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. It must be fixed before I take leave of you to-day. Every thing
      must be finally settled. When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I did not mean that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon, then, as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not sooner than&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not longer at the utmost than a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A month? It is a very short time, a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is a month too long. Make it a month, or less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a month, then: this day month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This day month&mdash;to-day being Friday&mdash;falls on Sunday. Say,
      rather this day four weeks, the 25th of July.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall I get ready in that interval?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall I live through that interval?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What interval? Talking about music, as usual?&rdquo; said Mrs. Hart, entering
      at this moment. &ldquo;Mr. Ripley, how do you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the happiest man in the world,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you. Have you won a case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have won a wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you doubly. Who is the lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me present her to you,&rdquo; he laughed, taking Ruth by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart dropped every thing she held&mdash;scissors, spectacles,
      knitting-bag&mdash;struck an astonished attitude, and uttered a sharp cry
      of surprise. Ruth blushed and smiled. For an instant the two ladies stood
      off and eyed each other. Then simultaneously they rushed toward each
      other, and fell into each other&rsquo;s arms; and then there were tears and
      kisses and incoherent sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, &ldquo;I congratulate you trebly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hart, turning to Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while every body was very happy and very sentimental.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, toward midnight, Arthur returned to his own abode, Hetzel asked him
      where he had spent the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In heaven,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with what particular divinity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Mrs. Lehmyl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. And&mdash;and what do you suppose? She and I are going to be
      married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we are engaged, betrothed. We are going to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Engaged? Betrothed? Married? You? Nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the kind. Our wedding day is fixed for the 25th of next
      month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, be rational.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am rational. Why should I jest about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you suddenly fallen heir to a fortune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not; why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Why, what are you going to get married on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean who&rsquo;s to foot the bills?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my income, have I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, your income. Oh, to be sure. Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;how many thousands did
      it amount to last year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It amounted to fifteen hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen hundred what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hundred dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you seriously intend to marry on that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it won&rsquo;t keep your wife in pocket handkerchiefs, let alone feeding
      and clothing her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought about it, but I&rsquo;m sure we can get along on fifteen
      hundred&mdash;added to what I can earn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was her opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mention the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You asked her to marry you without exhibiting your bank account. Shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We love each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When poverty comes in at the door, what is it love&rsquo;s habit to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such love as ours waxes greater.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and your mother. What will she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to write to her to-night&mdash;now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has your mother much respect for my judgment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know she has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, tell her from me that you&rsquo;ve just done a most sensible thing;
      that your bride&rsquo;s an angel, yourself a trump, and each of you to be envied
      above all man and woman kind.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;ENTER MRS. PEIXADA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE four weeks had
      wound away. I shall not detain the reader with a history of them. The
      log-book of a prosperous voyage is apt to be dull literature. They were
      four weeks of delightful progress toward a much-desired goal&mdash;four
      weeks of unmitigated happiness. The course of true love ran smooth. Time
      flew. Looking forward, to be sure, Arthur thought the hoped-for day would
      never come. But looking backward from the eve of it, he was compelled to
      wonder whither the time had sped.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Thursday, the 24th of July, in the office of
      Assistant-district-attorney Romer, were seated Arthur, Peixada, and Mr.
      Romer himself. Arthur held an open letter in his hand. The letter, written
      in a heavy, English chirography, was signed with considerable flourish,
      &ldquo;Reginald Graham.&rdquo; Arthur had just finished reading it aloud. Said he,
      folding it up and putting it into his pocket, &ldquo;So all trace of her is
      lost. We are back at the point we started from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Said Peixada, &ldquo;Well, we shall simply be obliged to adopt the plan that I
      suggested in the first place&mdash;advertise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Assented Romer, &ldquo;Yes, an advertisement is our last hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A forlorn one. She would never answer it,&rdquo; croaked Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; said Romer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon the adroitness with which the advertisement is framed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for instance? Give us a sample.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me think,&rdquo; said Romer. After a moment&rsquo;s reflection, &ldquo;How would this
      answer?&rdquo; And he applied pen to paper. Presently he submitted the paper for
      inspection to his companions. Its contents were as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Peixada.&mdash;If Mrs. Judith Peixada, </i>née<i> Karon, widow of
      Bernard Peixada, Esquire, late of the city of New York, deceased, and
      formerly administratrix of the goods, chattels, and credits of said
      decedent, will communicate either personally or by letter with her
      brother-in-law, Benjamin Peixada, No.&mdash;&mdash;-Reade Street, New
      York, she will learn something affecting the interests of her estate
      greatly to her advantage.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, I think,&rdquo; said Romer, &ldquo;ought to be inserted in the principal
      newspapers of America, England, France, and Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call first-rate,&rdquo; was Peixada&rsquo;s comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur held his peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; demanded Romer, &ldquo;how does it strike <i>you?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur deliberated; at length said, &ldquo;Candidly, Romer, do you regard that
      as altogether square and above-board?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? It&rsquo;s a decoy. The use of decoys in dealing with criminals&mdash;this
      woman is a criminal, mind you; a murderess and practically a thief as well&mdash;the
      use of decoys in such cases is justified by a hundred precedents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; asked Peixada. &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s the matter with
      me,&rdquo; retorted Arthur, a bit sharply; &ldquo;but I must say, I think such a
      proceeding as this is pretty low.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come; no, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; urged Romer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. And what&rsquo;s more, I won&rsquo;t lend myself to it. If that advertisement
      appears in the papers, Mr. Peixada will have to retain another man in my
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, goodness alive, it&rsquo;s our last resort. Would you rather have the
      whole business fall through? Be reasonable. Why, it&rsquo;s a ruse the daintiest
      men at the bar wouldn&rsquo;t stick at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they wouldn&rsquo;t; but I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what else is there to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; said Arthur, not heeding Romer&rsquo;s question, &ldquo;you make a
      great mistake in fancying that she would be deceived by it. If that woman
      is any thing, she&rsquo;s shrewd. She&rsquo;s far too shrewd to bite when the hook&rsquo;s
      in sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean she&rsquo;d sniff danger at once&mdash;divine that it is&mdash;what you
      have called it&mdash;a decoy. What under the sun could her brother-in-law
      have to communicate that would be to her advantage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Romer, shrugging his shoulders; &ldquo;suggest a more
      promising move, and I&rsquo;ll be with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not too squeamish. I won&rsquo;t connive
      at downright falsehood; but I&rsquo;m willing to compromise. It&rsquo;s a bitter pill
      to swallow&mdash;it goes against the grain&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll consent to
      something like this. Let me take your pen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur scratched off a line or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Peixada.&mdash;If Mrs. Judith Peixada, </i>née<i> Karon, widow of
      Bernard Peixada, Esquire, deceased, will communicate with her
      brother-in-law, Benjamin Peixada, No.&mdash;&mdash; Reade Street, New
      York, she will confer a favor,&ldquo;</i> was what Arthur had written.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he added verbally, &ldquo;will be quite as likely to fetch her as the
      other. Its very frankness will disarm suspicion. Besides, it&rsquo;s not such an
      out-and-out piece of treachery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think, Mr. Peixada?&rdquo; inquired Romer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I think she&rsquo;d sooner cut her thumbs off than do me a favor. But I
      leave the decision with you lawyers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may as well repeat,&rdquo; volunteered Arthur, &ldquo;that in the event of your
      employing the form Mr. Romer drew, I shall withdraw from the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Romer, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure Ripley isn&rsquo;t right. At any rate, no harm
      giving his way a trial. If it should fail to attract our game, we can use
      sweeter bait later on. Who&rsquo;ll see to its insertion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to beg you to do that,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;because to-morrow I&rsquo;m
      going out of town&mdash;to stay about a fortnight. I shall be on deck
      again two weeks from Monday&mdash;August 11th. Meanwhile, here&rsquo;s my
      country address. Telegraph me, if any thing turns up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Telling the story of his morning&rsquo;s work to Hetzel, he concluded thus, &ldquo;I
      suppose it was a legitimate enough stratagem&mdash;one that few lawyers
      would stop at&mdash;but, all the same, I feel like a sneak. I should like
      to kick myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel responded, cheeringly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made your own bed, and now you&rsquo;ve
      got to lie in it. You ought to have observed these little drawbacks to the
      beauty of Themis, before you dedicated yourself to her service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day in Mrs. Hart&rsquo;s parlor, Arthur Ripley and Ruth Lehmyl were
      married. Besides themselves and the clergyman who tied the knot, the only
      persons present were Arthur&rsquo;s mother, Mrs. Hart, Julian Hetzel, and a
      certain Mr. Arthur Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last named gentleman was Arthur&rsquo;s godfather, and had been a classmate
      of Arthur&rsquo;s father at Yale college. He was blessed with a wife, a couple
      of married daughters, and a swarm of grandchildren of both sexes; despite
      which, he had always taken a more than godfatherly interest in his
      namesake. For whatever business Arthur had to do, prior to his connection
      with Peixada, he was indebted to Mr. Flint. It was but natural, therefore,
      that he should have apprised Mr. Flint of his matrimonial projects as soon
      as they were distinctly formed. He had visited him one day at his office,
      and asked him to attend the wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The 25th of July?&rdquo; cried Mr. Flint. &ldquo;At such short notice? And my wife
      and Sue and Nellie away in Europe! It&rsquo;s a pity I can&rsquo;t call them home by
      the next steamer, to wish you joy. It&rsquo;ll break their hearts not to be
      present at your marriage. However&mdash;however, where are you going on
      your wedding-journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind. We were thinking of some place on the New
      Jersey coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The New Jersey coast is all sand and glare. It would spoil your bride&rsquo;s
      complexion. I&rsquo;ll tell you what you&rsquo;d better do. You&rsquo;d better go and pass
      your honeymoon at my cottage in New Hampshire&mdash;Beacon Rock. It&rsquo;s shut
      up and doing no one any good&mdash;consequence of my wife&rsquo;s trip to
      Europe. Say the word, and I&rsquo;ll wire Perkins&mdash;my general factotum
      there&mdash;to open and air the house, start fires, and be ready to
      welcome you with a warm dinner on the 26th.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too kind. I don&rsquo;t know what to say,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then say nothing. I&rsquo;ll take yes for granted. You&rsquo;ll find Beacon Rock just
      the place for a month&rsquo;s billing and cooing. Eastward, the multitudinous
      sea; westward, the hardy New England landscape; and all around you, the
      sweetest air it will ever be your luck to breathe. Look here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flint opened a drawer of his desk and extracted a pile of photographs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Beacon Rock taken from every available point of view. Here are
      some glimpses of the interior,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Divided between delight and gratitude, Arthur could only stammer forth
      broken phrases.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by the way, what&rsquo;s her address?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Flint, as Arthur was on
      the point of bidding him good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I had told you. You&rsquo;ll be sure to call soon, won&rsquo;t you? No. 46
      Beekman Place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, mum&rsquo;s the word,&rdquo; proceeded Mr. Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to breathe a syllable of this business to your
      sweetheart. Lead her to suppose that you&rsquo;re going to some Purgatorial
      summer hotel; and then enjoy her surprise when she spies Beacon Rock. Oh,
      yes, I&rsquo;ll call and pay her my respects&mdash;likely enough some night this
      week. Good-by. God bless you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flint called, pursuant to his promise. On the stoop, as he was
      leaving, he clapped Arthur upon the shoulder, and cried, &ldquo;By George, my
      boy, your Jewess is a jewel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three days later came a paper parcel, addressed to Mrs. Lehmyl. It
      contained a small purple velvet box. To the outside of the box was
      attached a card, bearing the laconic device, &ldquo;Sparks from a Flint.&rdquo;
       Inside, upon a cushion of lavender silk lay a gold breastpin, from the
      center of which a cluster of wondrous diamonds shot prismatic rays. It was
      the sole bit of jewelry that adorned Ruth&rsquo;s wedding-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately after the ceremony,&rdquo; says Hetzel, in a letter written at the
      time, &ldquo;they got into a hack, and were driven to the Fall River boat. We,
      who were left behind, crossed the street and assembled upon the <i>loggia</i>.
      There we waited till the Bristol hove in sight down the river. Then, until
      it had disappeared behind Blackwell&rsquo;s Island, there was much waving of
      handkerchiefs between the travelers&mdash;whom we could make out quite
      clearly, leaning against the rail&mdash;and us poor stay-at-homes.
      Afterward, Mrs. Ripley and Mrs. Hart adapted their handkerchiefs to other
      purposes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A week elapsed before the bride and groom were heard from. Eventually
      Hetzel got a voluminous missive. Portions of it read thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Boston, as our train didn&rsquo;t leave till noon, we sought the Decorative
      Art Rooms, and spent an hour or so coveting the pretty things that they
      are full of. At the depot I had a slight unpleasantness with the potentate
      from whom I bought our tickets&mdash;(confound the insolence of these
      railroad officials! Why doesn&rsquo;t some ingenious Yankee contrive an
      automaton by which they may be superseded?)&mdash;but despite it, we got
      started comfortably enough, and were set down at Portsmouth promptly at
      three o&rsquo;clock. She enjoyed the drive in an open carriage through the
      quaint old New England town immensely; but when we had reached the open
      country, and were being whisked over bridges, down leafy lanes, across
      rugged pasture lands, on our way to New Castle, her pleasure knew no
      bounds. There is something peculiarly refreshing in this keen New
      Hampshire air, compounded as it is of pine odors and the smell of the sea,
      and something equally refreshing in this homely New Hampshire landscape,
      with its thorns and thistles growing alongside daisies and wild roses.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      as we spun onward behind the horses&rsquo; hoofs. Now and then, much to her
      consternation, a brilliant striped snake darted from the foot-path into
      the bushes.... I had given her to believe, you know, that our destination
      was the * * * hotel, a monstrous barracks of an establishment, perched on
      the top of a hill in this neighborhood; and when we clattered past it
      without stopping, she was altogether mystified. I parried her questions
      successfully, however; and at the end of another half mile Beacon Rock
      rose before us.... For a while we did&mdash;could do-nothing but race
      around the outside of the house, and attempt by eloquent attitudes,
      frantic gestures, ecstatic monosyllables, to express something of the
      admiration which it inspired. Mr. Flint had shown me photographs of the
      cottage before I left New York; but he had shown me no photographs of the
      earth, sea, and sky by which it is surrounded&mdash;and that is its
      superlative merit. It falls in perfectly with the nature round about. It
      is indigenous&mdash;as thoroughly so as the seaweed, the stone walls, the
      apple trees. It looks as though it might have grown out of the soil: or as
      if the waters, in a mood of titanic playfulness, had cast it up and left
      it where it stands upon the shore. Fancy a square tower, built of
      untrimmed stone, fifty feet in height and twenty in diameter, springing
      straight up from a bare granite ledge&mdash; which, in its turn, sprouts
      from a grassy lawn, which, in its turn, slopes gradually down to the rocks
      at the sea&rsquo;s edge. This solemn, sturdy tower is pierced at its base by
      divers sinister looking portholes, which suggest cannon and ambushed
      warriors, but which, in point of fact, perform no more bellicose a
      function than that of admitting daylight into the cellar. Above these
      there are deep-set windows, through which the sun pours merrily all day
      long. I am seated at one of them, writing, now. . . . The tower faces the
      sea, and defies it. Behind the tower, and sheltered by it, nestles the
      cottage proper, a most picturesque, gabled, rambling structure of wood,
      painted terra cotta red... . . I don&rsquo;t know how long we stood around
      outside. Finally, Mr. Perkins, a native who, aided by his wife, cooks and
      &rsquo;chores&rsquo; for us, suggested the propriety of entering. We entered; and if
      the exterior had charmed us, the interior simply carried us away. I shall
      not attempt an itemized description of it, because probably I shouldn&rsquo;t be
      able to make the picture vivid enough to be worth your while. But imagine
      the extreme of aestheticism combined with the extreme of comfort, and you
      will get a rough notion of our environment. There are broad, open fire
      places, deep chimney corners, luxurious Turkey rugs, antique chairs and
      tables, beautiful pictures, interesting books&mdash;though we don&rsquo;t read
      them&mdash;and every thing else a fellow&rsquo;s heart could desire. There is no
      piano&mdash;the sea air would make short work of one&mdash;but I have
      hired a guitar from a Portsmouth music dealer, and she accompanies her
      songs on this.... Our mode of existence has been a perpetual <i>dolce far
      niente</i>, diversified by occasional strolls about the country&mdash;to
      Fort Constitution, a ruin of 1812&mdash;to the hotel, where a capital
      orchestra dispenses music every afternoon&mdash;or simply across the
      meadows, without an objective point. We can sight several light-houses
      from the tower windows; and a mile out at sea, in everlasting
      restlessness, floats a deep-voiced, melancholy bell-buoy, which recalls
      all the weird creeping of the flesh we had in reading the shipwreck in <i>L&rsquo;homme
      qui rit</i>.. . . Of course we have written a glowing letter of thanks to
      Mr. Flint. She, I forgot to tell you, could not at first believe her
      senses&mdash;believe that this little earthly paradise was meant for our
      occupation. When at last the truth was borne in upon her, you ought to
      have witnessed her delight.... Oh, Julian, old boy, you can&rsquo;t form the
      least conception of the great, radiant joy that fills my heart. I am
      really half afraid that it&rsquo;s a dream from which I shall presently wake up.
      I don&rsquo;t dare to verify it by pinching myself, lest that misfortune might
      indeed befall me. My happiness is so much in excess of other men&rsquo;s, I
      don&rsquo;t feel that I deserve it; and sometimes I am tormented by a morbid
      dread that it may not last. Just think, <i>she is actually my wife!</i>
      Ah, how my heart leaps, when I say that to myself, and realize all that it
      means!.... I have tried to put business quite out of my mind; but now and
      then it recurs to me, despite myself. I feel more and more uncomfortable
      about that advertisement. I have no doubt the woman richly deserves the
      worst that can happen to her, and all that, but nevertheless I can&rsquo;t get
      rid of a deucedly unpleasant qualm of conscience, when I think of the trap
      I have helped to set for her. Between ourselves, I derive some consolation
      from the thought that the chances are ninety-nine in a hundred that she
      will decline to nibble at our bait.... Unless I telegraph to the contrary,
      expect us to breakfast with you to-morrow week&mdash;Saturday, August
      9th.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel carried his letter across the street, and gave it to Mrs. Hart.
      She, not to be outdone, read aloud fragments of one which she had received
      from Ruth by the same mail. Among the paragraphs in the latter which she
      suppressed was this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have offered twice to tell him the whole story. I very much want to do
      so&mdash;to have it off my mind. It doesn&rsquo;t seem right that I should keep
      it secret; and he is so kind and tender, I feel that I could bring myself
      to tell him every thing. But with characteristic generosity, he declines
      to listen&mdash;bids me keep my secret as a proof of his confidence in me.
      Perhaps, then, it will be just as well for me to wait till we get back to
      town. Sooner or later&mdash;and the sooner, the better&mdash;I shall
      insist upon his allowing me to speak. A regret grows upon me daily that I
      did not insist upon that before we were married. Though I know so well
      that he loves me, my heart stands still when I stop to think, &rsquo;How may he
      feel towards me when he knows it all?&rsquo; or, &rsquo;Suppose before I have
      explained it to him, he should hear it from somebody else?&rsquo; Oh, it is not
      possible that he will cease to care for me, is it? I wish I could go to
      him this instant, and tell him about it, and then for good and all know my
      fate. Why did I wait till we were married? I could not bear to have him
      change in his feelings toward me now. Oh, I wish this miserable secret
      were off my mind&mdash;it tortures me with such terrifying doubts. But
      perhaps I had best not interrupt the happiness of his holiday by
      introducing a subject which he appears anxious to avoid. Do you agree with
      me? I say, I wish I could go, and tell it to him; and yet when the time
      comes for doing so, I am afraid my tongue will cleave to the roof of my
      mouth. If it should destroy his love for me! make him despise me! If for a
      single moment, as I was speaking, he should recoil from me!&mdash;withdraw
      his hand from mine! Oh, God, why can not the past be blotted out? I <i>must</i>
      speak to him before any body else can do so. If some one of his
      acquaintances should recognize me, and tell him, what might he not do? He
      <i>thinks</i> he would not care. He says <i>no matter what the past has
      been, it is totally indifferent to him.</i> But perhaps he would not feel
      that way if he really knew it. God bless him and keep him from all pain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saturday morning, surely enough, the truants came home, and took up their
      quarters at Mrs. Hart&rsquo;s, where for the present they were to remain. They
      hoped to set up a modest establishment of their own in the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late Monday forenoon Arthur screwed his courage to the sticking place, and
      tore himself away from his wife&rsquo;s side. Reading the newspapers on his way
      down town, he had the satisfaction of seeing himself in print. The Peixada
      advertisement occupied a conspicuous position. He went straight to his
      office, where he found a number of letters waiting for him. These he
      disposed of as speedily as might be; and then he sallied forth to call
      upon Mr. Flint. He got back at about halfpast two o&rsquo;clock. Less than five
      minutes later, his office-boy stuck his head through the doorway, and
      announced, &ldquo;A gentleman to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman appeared. The gentleman wore the garb of a porter. &ldquo;I come
      from Mr. Peixada, sir, with a note,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur took the note and broke it open. The gum on the envelope was still
      damp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The note bore evidence of having been dashed off in haste. Here it is:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Office of B. Peixada &amp; Co.,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Reade Street,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New York, Aug. 11, 1884.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are in town, (and to-day was the day fixed for your return),
      please come right over here at your earliest convenience. <i>Mrs. P. is in
      my private office!</i> I am keeping her till your arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B. Peixada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur stood still, his eyes glued upon this sheet of paper, long enough
      to have read it through a dozen times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any answer?&rdquo; Mr. Peixada&rsquo;s envoy at last demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;of course&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go along with you at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His heart was palpitating. The prospect of a face to face encounter with
      the redoubtable Mrs. Peixada caused him unwonted trepidation. The tidings
      conveyed in Peixada&rsquo;s note were so unexpected and of such grave
      importance, no wonder Arthur&rsquo;s serenity was ruffled. Striding up Broadway
      at the messenger&rsquo;s heels, he tried to picture to himself the impending
      scene. The trap had sprung. What manner of creature would the quarry turn
      out to be? Poor woman! There was a lot of trouble in store for her. But it
      was not his fault. He had done nothing but that which his duty as an
      attorney had required of him. He would exert his influence in her behalf&mdash;try
      to smooth things down for her, and make them as comfortable as under the
      circumstances they could be. Still for all slips of hers, she was one of
      Eve&rsquo;s family. He felt that he pitied her from the bottom of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peixada was nervously pacing back and forth in the show-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he cried, catching hold of Arthur&rsquo;s hand and wringing it vigorously,
      &ldquo;you have come! What luck, eh? I can scarcely believe it is true. I&rsquo;m
      quite put about by it, I declare. She walked in here, as large as life,
      not half an hour ago, and asked to see me. I had no idea the sight of her
      would upset me so. I told her that my business with her was of a legal
      nature, and I guessed she&rsquo;d better wait while I sent round for my
      attorney. But I was desperately afraid you hadn&rsquo;t got back. She acted just
      like a lamb. I tell you, that advertisement was a happy thought, wasn&rsquo;t
      it? Pity we didn&rsquo;t advertise in the first place, and so save all that
      delay and money. But I&rsquo;m not complaining&mdash;not I. I&rsquo;d be willing to
      spend twice the same amount right over again for the same result. Now
      we&rsquo;ll get a round hundred thousand; and I won&rsquo;t forget you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you notified Mr. Romer, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; of course. Sent word for him to come with his officers. She&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      in my private office&mdash;there&mdash;behind that door. Won&rsquo;t you go in,
      and tell her about the will, and keep her occupied till they get here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I think it would be best to wait,&rdquo; said Arthur, his voice
      trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no. She&rsquo;ll begin to get impatient. Please go in now. It&rsquo;ll
      relieve my agitation, anyhow. I&rsquo;m really surprised to find myself so
      shaken up. Here&mdash;this is the door. Open it, and go ahead in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;very well,&rdquo; consented Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand upon the knob, fortified himself with a long breath, and
      entered the room. Peixada, sticking his head in behind him, rattled off,
      &ldquo;Here, madam, is the gentleman I spoke to you about. He&rsquo;ll explain what we
      want you for,&rdquo; and withdrew, slamming the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peixada&rsquo;s private office was scarcely more than a hole in the wall&mdash;a
      small, square closet, lighted by a single grimy window, and destitute of
      furniture except for a desk and a couple of chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of these chairs, with her back toward the door, and engaged
      apparently in looking out of the window, sat a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing still, a yard beyond the threshold, Arthur said, &ldquo;I beg your
      pardon, madam&mdash;Mrs. Peixada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady rose, turned around, faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady was his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight, startled smile crossed her face. &ldquo;Why&mdash;Arthur&mdash;you&mdash;?&rdquo;
       she began in atone of surprise, her eyes brightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly a change; a look of perplexity, followed by one of
      enlightenment, as if a dreadful truth had burst upon her. The blood sank
      from her cheeks, her lip curled, her breast fluttered&mdash;a terrible
      fire flashed from her eyes. She drew herself up. She was awful, but she
      was superb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I see. So you have been prying into my secrets behind my
      back&mdash;you, who were too magnanimous to let me tell them to you! It
      was for you that Mr. Peixada bade me wait. This is the surprise he spoke
      of&mdash;a surprise of your contriving. You have found out who I am. I
      hope you are&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She broke off. Her voice had been very low, but had vibrated with passion.
      Now, the flaming, contemptuous eyes with which she covered him, spoke her
      mind more plainly than her tongue could.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, upon her first rising and facing him, had started back, gasping, &ldquo;Good
      God&mdash;you&mdash;Ruth!&rdquo; Since then a chaos of emotions had held him,
      dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      But gradually he recovered himself in some measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face a picture of blank amazement, &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, Ruth, what does
      this mean?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not hear him. Her anger of a moment since gave way to a paroxysm
      of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, merciful God,&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;how I have been deceived! Oh, to think
      that he&mdash;my&mdash;my husband&mdash;Oh, it is too much! It is more
      than I can bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She broke down in a torrent of tears and sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      An impulse carried him to her side. He put his arm around her waist, drew
      her to him, bent over her, stammered out broken syllables of love,
      comfort, entreaty.
    </p>
    <p>
      His touch rekindled her wrath, and endowed her frame with preternatural
      strength. She repulsed him&mdash;flung him away from her, over against the
      opposite wall, with as little effort as if he had been a stick in her
      path. This fragile woman, towering above this stalwart man, her cheeks now
      burning scarlet, her limbs quivering with strong emotion, cried, &ldquo;How dare
      you touch me? How dare you speak to me? How dare you insult me with your
      presence? Is it not enough what you have <i>done</i>, without forcing me
      to remain in the same room with you? Are you not content to have consorted
      with Benjamin Peixada&mdash;to have listened to the story of your wife&rsquo;s
      life from that man&rsquo;s lips&mdash;without coming here to confront me with it&mdash;to
      compel me to defend myself against his accusations. Wasn&rsquo;t it enough to
      put that advertisement in the paper? Haven&rsquo;t you sufficiently punished me
      by decoying me to this place, as you have done? What more do you want?
      What new humiliation? Though you hate me, now that you know who I am and
      what I haye done&mdash;you, who talked of loving me in spite of every
      thing&mdash;can you not be merciful, and leave me alone? Go&mdash;out of
      my sight&mdash;or, at least, stand aside and let me go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her words were followed by a prolonged, convulsive shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exerting his utmost self-control, dazed and bewildered as he was, he
      began, &ldquo;Ruth, will you not give me a chance to speak? Will you not listen
      to me? Can&rsquo;t you see that this is some&mdash;some frightful error into
      which we have fallen&mdash;which we can only right by speaking? You are
      doing me a great wrong, Ruth. You are wronging yourself. I beg of you,
      subdue your anger&mdash;oh, for God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t look at me like that.
      Try to be calm, Ruth, and let us talk together. Let me explain to you.
      Explain to me, for I am as hopelessly in the dark as you can be. Let us
      have some understanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His plea passed totally without effect: I suppose, because his wife was a
      woman. The tumult and the violence of the shock she had sustained had
      shattered her good sense. Her perceptive faculties were benumbed. Her
      entire vitality was absorbed by her pain and her indignation. I doubt
      whether she had heard what he said. But she caught at the last word, at
      any rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understanding? What is there to understand? I understand&mdash;I
      understand quite enough. I understand that you have sought information
      about me from Benjamin Peixada. I understand that it was you who got me
      here by false pretenses&mdash;by that advertisement. I understand that you&mdash;you
      think I am&mdash;that you believe what Benjamin Peixada has told you&mdash;and
      that&mdash;that the love you protested so much about, has all&mdash;all
      died away&mdash;and you&mdash;you shudder to think that I am your wife.
      Well, you may understand this, that I too shudder. I shudder to think that
      you are my husband&mdash;to think that you could have done this behind my
      back&mdash;that&mdash;that you&mdash;even when you were pretending to love
      me most, and telling me that you did not care about my secret&mdash;even
      then, you were fraternizing with Benjamin Peixada! You may understand
      that, however base you may believe me to be, I believe you to be baser
      still. Oh, if you would only go away, and never, never intrude yourself
      upon my sight again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Completely undone, he could only press his hands to his temples, and
      murmur, &ldquo;Oh my God, my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they stood: he, hanging his head, deserted by his manhood, crushed as
      by a blow from out the skies; she, erect, scornful, magnificent, all her
      womanhood aroused, all her unspeakable fury blazing in her eyes: so they
      stood, when, the door creaking open, two new personages advanced upon the
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not recognize them; but an instinct told him who they were. He was
      petrified. It did not occur to him to interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Peixada, I believe, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; said one of them, with a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to repeat his query thrice before she deigned to give him her
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with supreme dignity, bending her neck, &ldquo;What do you wish with me?&rdquo;
       she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, ma&rsquo;am, is a bench-warrant which I have the honor of serving upon
      you&mdash;matter of the People of the State of New York against Judith
      Peixada, otherwise known as Judith Karon, charged with murder in the first
      degree upon the person of Edward Bolen, late of the City, County, and
      State of New York, deceased. Please come along quiet, ma&rsquo;am, and make no
      resistance.&mdash;Donnelly, get behind her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer delivered himself rapidly of this address, and thrust his
      warrant into the prisoner&rsquo;s hand. The man spoken to as Donnelly, took a
      position behind her, obedient to orders. His superior opened the door, and
      pointing toward it, said, &ldquo;Please move along fast, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She, flinging one last, brief, scorching glance at her husband, bowed to
      the officer, and swept out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant Arthur remained motionless, riveted to the spot where she
      had left him. All at once his body quivered perceptibly. Then, realizing
      what had happened, he dashed headlong through the show-room&mdash;heedless
      of Romer, Peixada, and a score of Peixada&rsquo;s clerks, who stood still and
      stared&mdash;and out into the street, calling, &ldquo;Ruth, Ruth, come back,
      come back,&rdquo; at the top of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the curbstone, hatless, out of breath, stupefied, he halted and looked
      up and down the street. Ruth was nowhere to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he was joined by Romer and Peixada.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it&mdash;what has happened?&rdquo; Romer asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; he repeated, dully. &ldquo;Did&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you know? <i>She
      is my wife!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;&ldquo;WHAT REST TO-NIGHT?&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>UT yourself in his
      place. At first, as we have seen, he was simply stunned, bewildered. His
      breath was taken away, his understanding baffled. His senses were thrown
      into disorder. It was as if a cannon had gone off under his feet, all was
      uproar and smoke and confusion. But by degrees the smoke lifted. The
      outlines of things became distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      One stupendous fact stared Arthur in the face. Its magnitude was
      appalling. Its proportions were out of nature: The sight of it froze his
      blood, sickened his heart, turned his brain to stone. Judith Peixada, the
      woman whom he had pursued, insnared, betrayed; the woman whom he had
      delivered over to the clutches of the law, whom the officers had just
      dragged away from him, who even at this moment was under lock and key for
      a capital offense in the Tombs prison; the woman whom he had heretofore
      regarded as an abandoned murderess, beyond the pale of human pity, but
      whom he knew now, all appearances, all testimony, to the contrary
      notwithstanding, now at the eleventh hour, to be somehow as guiltless as
      the babe unborn: this woman was identical with his wife, with Ruth, with
      the lady whom he had wooed and married! He had been groping in the dark.
      He had brought his own house crashing down around his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vastness of the catastrophe, its apparent hopelessness, its grim,
      far-reaching corollaries, and the bitter knowledge that he might have
      prevented it, loomed up before him like a huge, misshaped monster, by
      which his earthly happiness was irretrievably to be destroyed. Add to this
      his consciousness of what she thought of him, and the sternest reader must
      pity his condition. She believed that, surreptitiously, he had been prying
      into the story of her life&mdash;a story which on more than one occasion
      she had volunteered to tell him, but to which, with feigned magnanimity,
      he had refused to listen, preferring to gather it covertly from other
      lips. She believed that, once having discovered her identity, he had
      ceased to love her, and had entered ruthlessly into a conspiracy whose
      object it was to lure her within reach of the criminal law. Unnatural,
      impossible, enormous, as such baseness would be, she nevertheless believed
      it of him. Ignorant of the circumstances, too indignant to suffer an
      explanation, she had jumped to the first conclusion that presented itself,
      and had gone to her prison, convinced that her husband had played her
      false.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sensations, of course, were far too complicated, far too turbulent, to
      be easily disentangled. Senseless hatred of Peixada for having crossed his
      path; senseless hatred of himself for having accepted Peixada&rsquo;s case;
      self-reproach, deep and bitter, for having forbidden her to share her
      secret with him; a wild desire to follow her, see her, speak to her, force
      her to understand; an intense wish to be doing something that might help
      to remedy matters, without the remotest notion of what ought to be done; a
      remorse that bordered upon fury, in thinking of the past; a despair and a
      terror that bordered upon madness, in thinking of the future; a sense of
      impotence that lashed him into frenzy, in thinking of the present; these
      were a few of the emotions fermenting in Arthur&rsquo;s breast. His intelligence
      was quite unhinged. He had lost his reckoning. He was buffeted hither and
      thither by the waves of thought and feeling that smote upon him, like a
      ship without a rudder in a stormy sea. He wandered aimlessly through the
      streets, neither knowing nor caring whither his steps might lead him:
      while the people along his route stopped to stare and wonder at this crazy
      man, who, without a hat, with eyes gleaming vacantly from their sockets,
      with the pallor of death upon his cheek, hurried straight forward, looking
      neither to the right nor to the left. His blood coursed like liquid fire
      through his arteries. There was the hubbub of bedlam in his ears. The sole
      relief he could obtain came from ceaseless motion.

      Toward four o&rsquo;clock that afternoon Hetzel, who lay prone upon his sofa,
      glancing lazily at the last issue of his favorite magazine, heard a heavy,
      unsteady footfall upon the stairs. Next instant the door flew open, and
      Arthur stood before him, hair awry, clothing disordered, countenance
      drawn, haggard, and soiled with dust and perspiration. Hetzel jumped up,
      and was at his side in no time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what is the matter with you?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur tottered a short distance into the room, and sank upon a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      It flashed across Hetzel&rsquo;s mind that his friend might possibly be the
      worse for drink. He laid hold of an ammonia bottle, and held it to
      Arthur&rsquo;s nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no; I don&rsquo;t need that,&rdquo; Arthur said, waving Hetzel away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, speak. Tell me, what is the trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Julian, I am ruined. If&mdash;if you knew what I have done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur buried his face in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;has&mdash;has something happened to your wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my wife, my wife,&rdquo; groaned Arthur, incoherently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel was perplexed, puzzled as to what to do or say; so, very sensibly,
      held his tongue. By and by Arthur began, &ldquo;My wife&mdash;my wife&mdash;oh,
      Hetzel, listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, brokenly, in half sentences, with frequent pauses, he managed to
      give Hetzel some account of the day&rsquo;s happening, winding up thus: &ldquo;You&mdash;you
      see how it is. She had offered to tell me that secret she said she had,
      but I wouldn&rsquo;t let her. I wanted her to keep it, to show her how much I
      loved her. At least, that&rsquo;s what I thought. But I&mdash;I know now that it
      was my cowardice. I was afraid to hear it. We were so happy, I didn&rsquo;t want
      to run any risk of having our happiness lessened by&mdash;by thinking
      about unpleasant things. My ignorance was comfortable&mdash;I dreaded
      enlightenment. I was afraid of what it might be. I preferred to keep it
      entirely out of my head. God, that was a terrible mistake! If I had only
      had the courage to let her speak! But I was a coward. I went to work and
      persuaded myself that I was acting from motives of generosity&mdash;that I
      wanted to spare her the pain of talking about it&mdash;that I loved her
      too much to care about it&mdash;and all that. But that wasn&rsquo;t it at all.
      It was weakness, and downright cowardice, and evasion of my duty. I see it
      plainly now&mdash;now, when worse has come to worst. And she&mdash;she
      thinks&mdash;she thinks that I made inquiries behind her back, and found
      out what it was, and got to be friendly with Peixada in that way, and then
      went and put that advertisement into the papers just for the sake of&mdash;of
      humiliating her&mdash;oh, God!&mdash;and she thinks it was I who arranged
      to have her taken to prison. She actually believes that&mdash;believes
      that I did that! She wouldn&rsquo;t listen to me. Her indignation carried her
      away. She doesn&rsquo;t see how unreasonable it is. She hates me and despises
      me, and never will care for me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel himself was staggered. Arthur&rsquo;s tale ended, there befell a long
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Arthur broke out petulantly, &ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you speak? Why don&rsquo;t
      you tell me what there is to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;I think it is very grave. You must let me consider a little
      while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another long silence. Hetzel, with bent head, was walking up and down the
      room. At length, coming to a standstill, he began, &ldquo;Yes, it is very
      serious. But it is not&mdash;can not be&mdash;irremediable. There must be
      a way out of it&mdash;of course there must. I&mdash;I&mdash;by Jove, let&rsquo;s
      look it squarely in the face. It will merely make matters worse to&mdash;to
      sit still and think about how bad it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else is there to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; answered Hetzel. &ldquo;We must get her \ out of prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very easy to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll do it, no matter how difficult it may be. She mustn&rsquo;t be left
      in the Tombs an hour longer than we can help. After that, it will be time
      to make her understand your part in the business. But now we must bend
      every muscle to get her out of prison. Whom do you know who will go bail
      for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of it. They don&rsquo;t take bail in&mdash;in&mdash;murder
      cases,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t? Are you sure? Is it never done? We must move heaven and earth
      to induce them to, in this case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s their rule. Romer might depart from it, she being&mdash;who she is.
      But I am afraid not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we must try, at any rate, and without dillydallying. Whom can you
      get to go upon her bond?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only person I know would be Mr. Flint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we must see Mr. Flint at once. Where does he live? Every minute is
      precious. We&rsquo;ll ask him to be her bondsman. Then we&rsquo;ll seek out Romer, and
      persuade him. If he&rsquo;s got a grain of manhood in him, he won&rsquo;t refuse. If
      we make haste, there&rsquo;s no reason why she shouldn&rsquo;t be free before sundown
      to-night. Come&mdash;let&rsquo;s be about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel&rsquo;s speech really inspired Arthur with a certain degree of hope and
      confidence. At all events, it was a relief to feel that he was doing
      something to repair the mischief he had wrought. So, in a hat borrowed
      from his chum, he led the way to Mr. Flint&rsquo;s residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way thither he began, &ldquo;To think that it was I who started the
      authorities upon her track&mdash;-I who urged them to prosecute her! And
      to think how the prosecution may end!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel retorted, &ldquo;End? I wish the end had come. I&rsquo;m not afraid of the end.
      I know nothing of the circumstances of the case, but I do know&mdash;and
      you know, and we all know&mdash;that she never was guilty of murder. I
      know that we can prove it, too&mdash;establish her innocence beyond a
      shade of suspicion. We shall only need strength and patience to do that.
      You needn&rsquo;t worry about the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the meanwhile, then! Meanwhile, fancy what she thinks of me! Fancy
      her despair! Meanwhile, she&mdash;she may die&mdash;or&mdash;she may go
      mad&mdash;or kill herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You little know your wife, if you think that. She&rsquo;s altogether too strong
      a woman to succumb to misfortune like that, altogether too noble a woman
      to do any thing of that kind. And as for her opinion of you, why, it
      stands to reason that she&rsquo;ll see the absurdity of it, as soon as the first
      shock has passed off. Just as soon as she&rsquo;s in a condition to use her
      mind, and think things over, she&rsquo;ll say to herself that there&rsquo;s something
      which she doesn&rsquo;t understand, and she&rsquo;ll ask you to explain. Take my word
      for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they mounted Mr. Flint&rsquo;s steps, Arthur said, &ldquo;Will&mdash;will you do
      the talking? I don&rsquo;t think I could bear to go over the whole story again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flint had but just got home from down-town. He was now in his bath. He
      sent word to the callers that he would dress and be with them as quickly
      as he could. They waited silently in the darkened drawing room, and
      listened to the ticking of an old-fashioned hall-clock. In about ten
      minutes Mr. Flint joined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel stated their errand. Of course, Mr. Flint was horrified and amazed.
      Of course, he agreed eagerly to do every thing in his power to aid them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, for Romer,&rdquo; said Hetzel. &ldquo;Where shall we find him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;We must look in the directory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stopped at an apothecary&rsquo;s shop, noted Romer&rsquo;s address, and started
      for the nearest elevated railway station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half way there Mr. Flint halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t depend upon the cars. We must have a carriage.
      There&rsquo;s no telling how much traveling we shall have to do, before this
      business is completed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They engaged a carriage at a hack-stand hard-by; and in it were jolted
      over the cobble-stones to Mr. Romer&rsquo;s abode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Romer was not at home!
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment they gazed blankly into each other&rsquo;s faces. Finally Mr. Flint
      said, &ldquo;Where has he gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; returned the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any body in this house who does know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His mother might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, we want to see his mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant left them in the vestibule, and went up-stairs. Presently she
      returned, accompanied by a corpulent old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you desire to see Mr. Romer upon official business?"&rsquo; inquired the old
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did, madam&mdash;important official business,&rdquo; said Mr. Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, gentlemen, you can&rsquo;t see him till to-morrow morning at his office.
      He don&rsquo;t see people officially after office-hours. If he did, he&rsquo;d get no
      peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flint accepted the situation, and was equal to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but this is business in which Mr. Romer is
      personally interested. We <i>must</i> see him to-night. To-morrow morning
      will be too late. If you know where he is, you&rsquo;d better tell us.
      Otherwise, I shan&rsquo;t answer for his displeasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, in that case,&rdquo; said the old lady, quite deceived by Mr. Flint&rsquo;s white
      lie, &ldquo;in that case, you&rsquo;ll find him dining at the * * * Club. At least, he
      said he should dine there, when he left the house this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, madam,&rdquo; said Mr. Flint. In the carriage, &ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; he
      added. &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have fallen out better. I&rsquo;m a member of the * * *
      Club, myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They entered the club-house. Mr. Flint led Arthur and Hetzel into the
      reception-room, where, for a moment, he left them alone. Shortly
      returning, &ldquo;Mr. Romer,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;is in the bowling-alley&mdash;hasn&rsquo;t
      yet gone up to dinner. I&rsquo;ve sent him my card.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In due time Romer appeared, his face flushed by recent exercise. Catching
      sight of Arthur, &ldquo;What, you&mdash;Ripley?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d fust been
      telling the fellows down-stairs about&mdash;that is&mdash;I&mdash;well, I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      real glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Romer,&rdquo; said Mr. Flint, plunging <i>in medias res</i>, &ldquo;I have
      ventured to disturb you in your leisure for the purpose of offering bail
      in the case of Mrs. Ripley, who, I am informed, was taken in custody
      to-day by your officers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Romer, &ldquo;a question of bail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;we want to give bail for the lady at once&mdash;in any amount
      that you may wish&mdash;but without delay. She must be out of prison
      before to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; mused Romer, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you&rsquo;ll manage it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manage it? What is there to be managed? I offer bail; it only remains for
      you to take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, excuse me, but I have no authority in the matter&mdash;no more than
      you yourself. Mr. Orson, my chief, is the man for you to see, and he&rsquo;s out
      of town. We don&rsquo;t take bail generally in murder cases; and <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t
      make an exception of this one&mdash;though I&rsquo;d like to, first rate, for
      Ripley&rsquo;s sake. Perhaps Mr. Orson might do so&mdash;in fact I should advise
      him to&mdash;but, as I&rsquo;ve said, he&rsquo;s not on hand. Then, the amount would
      have to be determined, the papers drawn, the proceedings submitted to a
      magistrate&mdash;and on the whole, it couldn&rsquo;t be arranged inside of a day
      or two, at the shortest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil you say!&rdquo; cried Mr. Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, I&rsquo;m sure. But that&rsquo;s about the size of it,&rdquo; said Romer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is&mdash;is there nothing to be done? Is this lady to remain
      indefinitely in the Tombs&mdash;a common prisoner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until you can bring the question before Mr. Orson, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, where is he, Mr. Orson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s on his vacation&mdash;down at Long Branch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The * * *.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. Will you go with me to Long Branch to-morrow morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow morning? No, I can&rsquo;t go to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve got a calendar on my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When can you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might arrange to run down to-morrow night, and come back Wednesday
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake, then, do so. On what train will you start with me
      to-morrow night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call at my office at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and I&rsquo;ll let you
      know. You may count, Ripley, upon my doing all I can for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Romer went back to his bowling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flint said, &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see that we can go any further to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to reconcile ourselves to waiting and hoping,&rdquo; said
      Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! Is she to&mdash;to pass the night in prison?&rdquo; cried Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, my dear boy,&rdquo; said Mr. Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must make the best of it.&rdquo; Turning to Hetzel. &ldquo;Where are you going
      now?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think&mdash;it has just occurred to me&mdash;that we ought to see Mrs.
      Hart,&rdquo; Hetzel returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, set me down at my house on your way up.&rdquo; And Mr. Flint gave
      the necessary instructions to the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart was posted on her stoop, peering anxiously up and down the
      street, as the carriage containing Hetzel and Arthur rumbled into Beekman
      Place. When she saw that the carriage had stopped directly in front of her
      domicile, she made a rush toward it, pulled open the door, and cried,
      &ldquo;Ruth, Ruth&mdash;at last you have come back! I was so much worried!&rdquo;
       Then, discovering her mistake, &ldquo;Oh, it is not Ruth? Where can she be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is perfectly safe,&rdquo; said Hetzel. &ldquo;Come into the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen her?&rdquo; questioned Mrs. Hart. &ldquo;She has been gone such a long
      time! I was frightened half to death. Tell me, why doesn&rsquo;t she come home?
      What&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart faltered. By this time they had reached the parlor, which was
      brilliantly lighted up; and at the spectacle of Arthur&rsquo;s face, livid
      enough at best, but rendered doubly so by the gas-jets, Mrs. Hart
      faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me reassure you. Mrs. Ripley is perfectly safe,&rdquo; repeated Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then&mdash;then, <i>why does he look like this?</i>&rdquo; pointing to
      Arthur, and laying a stress upon each syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Hetzel, &ldquo;and compose yourself; and he will tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Arthur, &ldquo;Now, Arthur, try to command your feelings, and tell Mrs. Hart
      all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As best he could, he told Mrs. Hart as much as was needful to make her
      comprehend the state of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart was nervous enough at the outset. As Arthur&rsquo;s story proceeded,
      her nervousness became more and more ungovernable. When she learned that
      Ruth had been carried off to prison, she cried, &ldquo;Oh, take me to her at
      once. I must go to her at once. She must not be left alone there all
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be impossible to obtain admittance at this hour,&rdquo; said Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But saying it did not suffice. Mrs. Hart insisted. &ldquo;Oh, they would surely
      let me in. She&mdash;she will die if she is left there alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel undertook to comfort her, and to bring her around to reason.
      Finally she was sufficiently calm to listen to the rest of what Arthur had
      to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      His tale complete, Hetzel took up the sequel, explaining how they had
      tried to have her liberated on bail, how Mr. Flint was to visit Mr. Orson
      at Long Branch to-morrow night, and going on to express his assurance that
      in a week&rsquo;s time at the furthest the storm would have blown over, and made
      way for calm and sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long while Mrs. Hart could only cry and utter inarticulate syllables
      of grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by Hetzel asked, &ldquo;Can you tell us how she came to go down there&mdash;to
      Mr. Peixada&rsquo;s place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hart. &ldquo;It was my fault. I advised her to. You see,
      this is the way it happened. After Arthur had left the house this morning,
      Ruth picked up the newspaper. She was just glancing over it&mdash;not
      reading any thing in particular&mdash;when all at once, she gave a little
      scream. I asked her what it was; and she said, &rsquo;Look here.&rsquo; Then she
      showed me the advertisement that he has spoken of. &rsquo;Would you pay any
      attention to it?&rsquo; she asked. I read it, and considered, and then asked her
      what action her impulse prompted her to take. She said that she hardly
      knew. If there was something they wanted of her, which was right and
      proper, she supposed she ought to do it; but she hated to have any
      dealings with Peixada. &rsquo;I thought Judith Peixada had been dead two years,&rsquo;
      she said; &rsquo;but now she comes to life again just when she is least
      expected.&rsquo; I suggested that she might write a letter. But on thinking it
      over she said, &rsquo;No. Perhaps the best thing I can do will be to go at once
      and beard the lion in his den. I shall worry about it otherwise. I may as
      well know right away what it is. After lunch I&rsquo;ll go down-town and call
      upon Mr. Peixada; and then I&rsquo;ll surprise Arthur in his office, and bring
      him home.&rsquo; Then I&mdash;I said I thought that was the best thing she could
      possibly do,&rdquo; Mrs. Hart interrupted herself to dry her eyes. Presently,
      &ldquo;You see, it was my fault,&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;I ought to have suspected that
      they meant foul play; but instead, I let her walk straight into their
      pitfall. Right after lunch, at about halfpast one, she started out. She
      promised to be home again by four o&rsquo;clock. When she didn&rsquo;t come and didn&rsquo;t
      come, I began to get more and more anxious about her. I was almost beside
      myself, when at last you arrived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel said, &ldquo;It is bad enough to think of her being locked up in prison,
      but that is not the worst. I&rsquo;m sure we can get her out of prison; and
      although I don&rsquo;t know the first thing about the case, I&rsquo;m sure that we can
      prove her innocence. The trouble now is this. She&rsquo;s suffering all manner
      of torments, because she totally misconceives her husband&rsquo;s part in the
      transaction. Our endeavor must be to put her husband&rsquo;s conduct before her
      in the right light&mdash;make her understand that he acted all along in
      good faith, and without the faintest suspicion that she and Judith Peixada
      were one and the same. She was so much incensed at him this afternoon,
      that she wouldn&rsquo;t let him justify himself. We must set this mistake right
      tomorrow morning. I think that you, Mrs. Hart, had better visit her as
      early to-morrow as they will admit you, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; interpolated Mrs. Hart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;And tell her Arthur&rsquo;s side of the story. When she understands
      that, she&rsquo;ll feel like another woman. Then he can see her, and talk to
      her, and find out the facts of the case, and lay them before the
      authorities. It seems to me that this is the plain course to take.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And meanwhile, meanwhile!&rdquo; cried Arthur, wringing his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Hetzel, &ldquo;show your grit. Look at Mrs. Hart. See how bravely
      she bears up. Do you want to make it harder for every one by your
      example?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Hart isn&rsquo;t her husband,&rdquo; Arthur retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he bit his lip and kept silence. Mrs. Hart sat bolt upright, staring
      at vacancy, with brows knitted into a tight frown. Hetzel tugged away at
      his whiskers, and was evidently thinking hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by the door-bell rang. A servant entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a note, ma&rsquo;am, a man just left,&rdquo; she said to Mrs. Hart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart read the note and passed it to Hetzel. It was written upon a
      half sheet of paper, headed in heavy black print, &ldquo;City Prison.&rdquo; It was
      brief:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, dear Friend:&mdash;You must be anxious about me. I have tried
      hard to get word to you. At last they have found a messenger for me. You
      see by this letter-heading where I am. The advertisement was a trick. But
      it was worse, much worse, than you can fancy. If I could only see you!
      Will you come to me to-morrow morning? I am too heartsick to write, Ruth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel was returning the note to Mrs. Hart, when Arthur stretched out his
      hand for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I not to read what my own wife has written?&rdquo; he demanded fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took in its contents at a glance. Even this sheet of common prison
      paper was sweet with that faint, evanescent perfume that clung to
      everything Ruth&rsquo;s fingers touched. Letting it drop to the floor, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      stand it,&rdquo; he cried in a loud voice, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard the vestibule door slam behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is mad,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hart. &ldquo;He will do himself an injury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he won&rsquo;t&mdash;not if I can stop him,&rdquo; said Hetzel; and he hurried
      forth upon Arthur&rsquo;s track.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he came back in a little while, panting for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ran as far as First Avenue,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;but he had succeeded in
      getting out of sight. Never mind. He&rsquo;ll come home all right. No doubt he
      needs to be alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once out of doors, Arthur dashed blindly ahead. It was a sultry night. The
      odor of ailanthus trees hung heavy on the air. Many people were abroad. On
      the door-steps of most of the houses, the inmates sat, chatting, smoking,
      dozing, airing themselves. The city had given itself over to rest and
      recreation. Through open windows escaped bursts of song and laughter and
      piano playing. Young girls, dressed in white, promenaded on the arms of
      young men who puffed cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur had no fixed destination. He walked, because walking was a
      counter-irritant. He walked rapidly, and took no notice of the sights and
      sounds round about him. He remembers dimly that he left the respectable
      quarters of the city far behind, and entered a maze of crooked, squalid,
      foul-smelling streets. Then, he remembers that all at once he looked up
      and wondered where he was. And there, a blot upon the sky, there loomed
      the prison that held his beloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained within eyeshot of this dismal structure till daybreak, when at
      last he went back to Beekman Place.

      CHAPTER IX.&mdash;AN ORDEAL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>RTHUR ran up the
      steps of Mrs. Hart&rsquo;s house, and, opening the door with his latch-key,
      entered the parlor. The gas was burning at full head. Hetzel was stretched
      at length in an easy-chair, his hands thrust deep into his
      trowsers-pockets. At sight of Arthur, he rose and advanced on tip-toe to
      meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush-sh,&rdquo; he said, putting his finger to his lips. He pointed to the
      sofa, upon which Mrs. Hart lay, asleep. Then he took Arthur&rsquo;s arm, and led
      him through the hall into the back room. There they seated themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to find you up,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been abed,&rdquo; said Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose nothing new has happened? You haven&rsquo;t heard from her again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They remained silent for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel began, &ldquo;After you left in that abrupt way, Mrs. Hart, who had borne
      up wonderfully, quite went to pieces. She has been in a half hysterical
      condition all night. I persuaded her to lie down about an hour ago, and
      now she&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur vouchsafed no comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have had a lot of reporters pestering us, too,&rdquo; Hetzel went on. &ldquo;Of
      course I refused to see them, one and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Arthur started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I suppose the whole thing is in the papers, curse them!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you looked to see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t time yet. The papers haven&rsquo;t been delivered yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur pulled out his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not going&mdash;run down,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but of course it&rsquo;s time. It must be
      seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know it was so late. I&rsquo;ll go see.&rdquo; Hetzel went away.
      Presently he returned, saying, &ldquo;Surely enough, here they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; queried Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel undid the newspapers, and commenced to look them over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all here&mdash;a column of it&mdash;on the front page,&rdquo; he
      groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said Arthur, extending his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the head-lines were as much as he had the heart to read. He threw the
      sheet angrily to the floor and began to stride back and forth across the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Hetzel, &ldquo;or you&rsquo;ll wake Mrs. Hart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to be sure,&rdquo; assented Arthur; and did as he was bidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by, &ldquo;Do you know at what hours visitors are admitted?&rdquo; Hetzel
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I think between ten and four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, we&rsquo;ll want a carriage here at halfpast nine. I&rsquo;ll send out
      now to order one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a second time Hetzel left the room. When he got back, he said that he
      had dispatched a servant to the nearest livery stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Mrs. Hart appeared, very old and gray and pallid. She
      came in without speaking, and took a chair near the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope your nap has refreshed you,&rdquo; Hetzel ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she replied dismally, &ldquo;I suppose it has.&mdash;Where have you
      been, Arthur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowhere&mdash;only out of doors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All three held their peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the servant returned from her errand, and told Hetzel that the
      carriage would be on hand at the proper time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bridget,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hart, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better brew some coffee, and serve it up
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Bridget had gone, &ldquo;You have sent for a carriage? At what hour are we
      to start?&rdquo; Mrs. Hart inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At half-past nine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if you will excuse me, I&rsquo;ll go up-stairs and get ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Hetzel. &ldquo;And while you&rsquo;re about it, you&rsquo;d better put a
      few things together to take to her, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, she won&rsquo;t need them. She&rsquo;ll be with us again to-day, will she not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, Mr. Flint can&rsquo;t see Mr. Orson till this evening. So, it seems
      to me&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I had forgotten,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hart, gulping down a sob, and left
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      During her absence, Bridget brought in the coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a cup up to your mistress,&rdquo; said Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he poured out a cup for Arthur. He had to use some persuasion to
      induce him to drink it; but eventually he prevailed. Having swallowed a
      portion for himself, he lighted a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better try one,&rdquo; he said, with a woful attempt at cheerfulness, offering
      the bunch to Arthur. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like tobacco to brace a man up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Arthur declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-past nine was leisurely in arriving. At last, however, they heard the
      grinding of carriage-wheels upon the pavement outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      They climbed into the carriage. The coachman cracked his whip. Off they
      drove.
    </p>
    <p>
      That drive was a purgatory. At its start their hearts were oppressed by a
      nameless terror. It had intensified into a breathless agony, before their
      drive was over. Their foreheads were wet with cold perspiration. Their
      lips were ashen. As they turned from Broadway into Leonard Street, and
      knew that they were nearing their journey&rsquo;s end, each of them
      instinctively winced, and gasped, and shuddered. When the carriage finally
      drew up before the prison entrance, not one of them dared to speak or to
      stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Hetzel said, &ldquo;Well, here we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an interval, he went on, &ldquo;Mrs. Hart, you, of course, will go in
      first. You must explain to her about Arthur, and induce her to see him.
      You can send word, or come back, when she&rsquo;s ready to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this, he opened the carriage door, dismounted, and helped Mrs. Hart
      to follow. Arthur remained behind. He closed his eyes for a little, and
      held his hands to his forehead. His hands were cold and damp. His forehead
      was now dry and hot; and he could count the pulsations of the arteries in
      his temples. His throat ached with a great lump. He mechanically watched
      the people pass on the sidewalk, and wondered whether any of them were as
      miserably unhappy as he. The myriad noises of the street smote his ears
      with a strange sharpness, and caused him from time to time to start and
      turn even paler than he had been. Gradually, however, he began to lose
      consciousness of outward things, and to think, think, think. He had plenty
      to think about. Pretty soon, he was fathoms deep in a brown study.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aroused by the reappearance of Hetzel and Mrs. Hart. They got into
      the carriage. The carriage moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what is the trouble now?&rdquo; Arthur asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn them for a set of insolent scoundrels!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel blurted out, forgetful of Mrs. Hart&rsquo;s sex. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t let us
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they insist on a tangle of red-tape&mdash;say we must have passes,
      and so forth, from the district-attorney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re on our way to procure them now.&rdquo; But at the
      district-attorney&rsquo;s office there was fresh delay. The clerk whose duty it
      was to make out the passes, had not yet reached his post; and none of his
      colleagues seemed anxious to play the lieutenant&rsquo;s part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel lost his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, what are you lazy louts paid for, I&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo; he thundered.
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your master? Where&rsquo;s Mr. Romer? I&rsquo;ll see whether you&rsquo;re to sit
      around here in your shirt-sleeves, grinning, or not. I want some one of
      you to wait on me, or I&rsquo;ll make it hot for the whole pack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got his passes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove back to the Tombs. This time Mrs. Hart encountered no obstacles
      to her entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel rejoined Arthur in the carriage. A quarter-hour elapsed before
      either spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur said, &ldquo;She&mdash;she&rsquo;s staying a long while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; responded Hetzel, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve got such a lot to talk about, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the end of another quarter-hour, more or less, Arthur complained, &ldquo;What
      under heaven can be keeping her so long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be patient,&rdquo; said Hetzel. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do no good to fret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By and by Arthur started up. &ldquo;By Jove, I can&rsquo;t wait any longer. I can&rsquo;t
      endure this waiting. I must go in myself,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just at this moment Mrs. Hart issued forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel ran to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was paler than ever. Her eyelids were red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may as well drive home,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, why not?&rdquo; asked Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it, as we drive along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how&mdash;how shall we break the news to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;d better speak to him now, before I get in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel approached the carriage window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur,&rdquo; he began, awkwardly, &ldquo;try&mdash;try to keep quiet, and not&mdash;the&mdash;the
      fact is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she ill? Is she dead?&rdquo; cried Arthur, with mad alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my dear boy; of course not. Only&mdash;only&mdash;just now&mdash;she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She refuses to see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was fully prepared for that. I knew she would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His head sank upon his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had covered half the distance between the Tombs and Beekman Place,
      when at length Arthur said, &ldquo;Please, Mrs. Hart, please tell me about your
      visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart shot a glance at Hetzel, as much as to ask, &ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo; He nodded
      affirmatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much to tell,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;They led me down a lot of stone
      corridors, and through a yard, and up a flight of stairs, and across a
      long gallery, past numberless little, black, iron doors; and at last we
      stopped before one of the doors, and the woman who was with me called
      out,&rsquo;.eixada, alias Ripley&rsquo;&mdash;only think of the indignity!&mdash;and
      after she had called it out that way two or three times, a little panel in
      the door flew open, and there&mdash;there was Ruth&rsquo;s face&mdash;so pale,
      so sad, and her eyes so large and awful&mdash;it made my heart sink. I
      supposed of course they were going to let me in; but no, they wouldn&rsquo;t.
      The prison woman said I must stand there, and say what I had to say to the
      prisoner in her presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart paused, and swallowed a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I stood there, so frightened at the sight of Ruth&rsquo;s face, that I
      didn&rsquo;t know what to do; till by and by she said, very softly, &rsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you
      going to kiss me, dear?&rsquo; Oh, her voice was so sweet and sad, I couldn&rsquo;t
      help it, but I burst out crying; and she cried, too; and she put her face
      up close to the open place in the door; and then we kissed each other; and
      then&mdash;then we just cried and cried, and couldn&rsquo;t speak a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The memory of her former tears brought fresh tears to Mrs. Hart&rsquo;s eyes.
      Drying them, she went on, &ldquo;We were crying like that, and never thinking of
      any thing else, when the prison woman said, &rsquo;If you have any communication
      to make to the prisoner, you&rsquo;d better make it right off, because you can&rsquo;t
      stay here all day, you know.&rsquo; Then I began about Arthur. I said, &rsquo;Ruth, I
      wanted to tell you that Arthur is down outside, and that he wishes to see
      you.&rsquo; Oh, if you could have seen the look that came upon her face! It made
      me tremble. I thought she was going to faint, or something. But no. She
      said, very calmly, &rsquo;It would do no good for me to see Arthur. It would
      only pain him and myself. I do not wish to see him. I could not bear to
      see him. That is what she said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, go on,&rdquo; groaned Arthur, as Mrs. Hart paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said she didn&rsquo;t want to see you, and couldn&rsquo;t bear to. I said, &rsquo;But,
      Ruth, you ought to see him. You and he ought to speak together, and try to
      understand each other.&rsquo; She said, &rsquo;There is no misunderstanding between
      us. I understand every thing.&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; said I, &rsquo;no, you don&rsquo;t.
      There is something which he wants to explain to you&mdash;about how he
      came to be associated with Mr. Peix-ada.&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;I don&rsquo;t care about that,&rsquo;
      said she. &rsquo;There are some things which he can not explain. I am miserable
      enough already. I need all my strength. I should break down, if I were to
      see him.&rsquo;&mdash;But I said, &rsquo;Consider, him, Ruth. You can&rsquo;t imagine how
      unhappy he is. He loves you so much. It is breaking his heart.&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;Loves
      me?&rsquo; she said. &rsquo;Does he still pretend to love me? Oh, no, he does not love
      me. He never loved me. If he had loved me, he would never have done what
      he did. Oh, no, no&mdash;I can not see him, I will not see him. You may
      tell him that I said it would do no good for us to see each other. Every
      thing is over and past between him and me.&rsquo; She had said all this very
      calmly. But then suddenly she began to cry again: and she was crying and
      sobbing as if her heart would break, and she couldn&rsquo;t speak a word, and
      all I could do was to try and soothe her a little, when the prison woman
      said I must come away. I tried to get her to let me stay&mdash;offered her
      money&mdash;but she said, &rsquo;No. It is dinner time now. No visitors are
      allowed in the building at dinner time. You must go.&rsquo;&mdash;So, I had to
      leave Ruth alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as I supposed,&rdquo; moaned Arthur. &ldquo;She hates me. All is over and past
      between us, she said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, man,&rdquo; protested Hetzel. &ldquo;It is merely a question of time. Mrs.
      Hart simply didn&rsquo;t have time enough. If she had been allowed to stay a
      half hour longer, your wife would have loved you as much as ever. She does
      love you as much as ever, now. But her heart is crushed and sore, and all
      she feels is the pain. It&rsquo;s less than twenty-four hours since the whole
      thing happened; she hasn&rsquo;t had time enough yet to think it over. We&rsquo;re
      going to have her home again to-morrow; and if between the three of us we
      can&rsquo;t undeceive her respecting your relations to Peixada&mdash;bring her
      to hear and comprehend the truth&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be mightily surprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drove for some blocks in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you give her her things, Mrs. Hart?&rdquo; Arthur asked, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hart; &ldquo;they wouldn&rsquo;t let me. I forgot to tell you that
      they made me empty my pockets before they led me to her. The prison woman
      took the things, and said she would examine them, and then give her such
      as were not against rules.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and it was a regular prison cell in which she was confined?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; it was horrible. The walls were whitewashed, and there was only
      one little bit of a grated window, and the floor was of stone, and the bed
      was a narrow iron cot, and she had just a wretched, old, wooden stool to
      sit on, and the air was something frightful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you tell her of our efforts to get bail for her?&rdquo; asked Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, I forgot all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d better write her a note, when we get home. I&rsquo;ll send a
      messenger with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I will,&rdquo; acquiesced Mrs. Hart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in Beekman Place she said to Hetzel: &ldquo;About that note you spoke of&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t feel that I can trust myself to write. I&rsquo;m afraid I should say
      something that&mdash;that might&mdash;I mean I think I <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>
      write to her. I should break down, if I tried. Won&rsquo;t you do it, instead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word from you would comfort her more than a dozen from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;it is such hard work for me to keep control of myself, as it is&mdash;and
      if I should undertake to write&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; said Hetzel. &ldquo;Can you let me have pen and paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What he wrote ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Ripley: I only want to send you this line or two, to tell
      you that your friends are hard at work in your behalf, and that before
      this time to-morrow we mean to have you safe and sound at home. Meanwhile,
      for Arthur s sake, try to bear up and be of good cheer. The poor boy is
      breaking his heart about you. All I can do for him is to promise that in a
      few hours, now, he shall hold you in his arms again. I should like to make
      clear to you in this note how it was that he seemed to have had a share in
      the trickery by which you were betrayed; but I am afraid I might make a
      bungle of it; and after all, it is best that you should hear the tale from
      his own lips, as you surely will to-morrow morning. I beg and pray that
      you will strive hard not to let this thing have any grave effect upon your
      health. That is what I most dread. Of other consequences I have no fear&mdash;and
      you need have none. If you will only exert your strength to bear it a
      little while longer, and come home to us to-morrow sound and well in
      health, why, we shall all live to forget that this break in our happiness
      ever occurred. I think I feel the full pain of your position. I know that
      it is of a sort to unnerve the staunchest of us. But I know too that you
      have uncommon powers at your command; and I beg of you, for your own sake,
      for Arthur&rsquo;s, for Mrs. Hart&rsquo;s, to call upon them now. Weather the storm
      for one more night, and then I vouch for the coming blue skies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you and be with you!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julian Hetzel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to add a postscript,&rdquo; said Arthur, when Hetzel laid down his pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;d better?&rdquo; asked Hetzel, dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me have it, will you?&rdquo; cried Arthur, savagely; and held out his hand
      for the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel gave it to him. On the blank space that was left he wrote: &ldquo;Ruth&mdash;my
      darling&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake, overcome your anger against me. Don&rsquo;t judge
      me before you have heard my defense. Be merciful, Ruth, and wait till you
      have let me speak and justify myself, before taking for granted that I
      have been guilty of treachery toward you. Oh, Ruth, how can you condemn me
      on mere appearances?&mdash;me, your husband. Oh, please, Ruth, <i>please</i>
      write me an answer, saying that you have got over the anger you felt for
      me yesterday and this morning, and that you will suspend judgment of me
      till I have had a chance to clear myself. I can not write my explanation
      here, now. I am not calm enough, and it is too long a story. Oh, Ruth, I
      shall go mad, unless you will promise to wait about condemning me. Write
      me an answer at once, and send it by the messenger who brings you this. I
      can not say any thing else except that I love you. Oh, you will kill me,
      if you go on believing what you told Mrs. Hart&mdash;that I do not love
      you. You must believe that I love you&mdash;you know I love you. Say in
      your answer that you know I love you. I love you as I never loved you&mdash;more
      than I ever loved you before. Oh, little Ruth, please cheer up, and don&rsquo;t
      be unhappy. If this thing should result seriously for your health, I&mdash;I
      shall die. Dear little Ruth, just try to keep up until to-morrow morning.
      If you will only come home all right to-morrow morning, then our
      sufferings will not count. Ruth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run out to the corner, and find some one to carry this
      to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went off. Mrs. Hart and Arthur sat silent and motionless in the parlor.
      In due time Hetzel got back. He too took a seat and kept his peace. So the
      afternoon wore away. No one spoke. Their minds were busy enough, God
      knows; but busy with thoughts which they dared not shape in speech. The
      clock on the mantel-piece ticked with painful distinctness. Street-sounds
      penetrated the closed windows&mdash;children&rsquo;s voices, at their games&mdash;the
      cries of fruit venders&mdash;hand-organ music&mdash;the noise of wheels on
      paving stones&mdash;and reminded the listeners that the life of the city
      was going on very much as usual. Now and then a steam-whistle shrieked on
      the river. Now and then one of our tongue-tied trio drew a deep, audible
      sigh. Ruth&rsquo;s piano, in the corner, was open. On the rack lay a sheet of
      music, and with it a tiny white silk handkerchief that she had doubtless
      thrown down carelessly, and left there, the day before. When Arthur
      perceived this, he got up, crossed the floor, took possession of it, and
      tucked it into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards six o&rsquo;clock the door-bell rang. All three started violently. The
      same notion occurred to all three at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;it is from her. It is her answer,&rdquo; gasped Arthur, and began to
      breathe quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel went to the door. After what seemed an eternity to those he had
      left behind, he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, replying to their glances; &ldquo;not yet. It is only your
      office-boy, Arthur. He has brought you your day&rsquo;s mail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur apathetically commenced to look over the envelopes. At last he came
      to one which he appeared on the point of opening. But then abruptly he
      seemed to change his mind, and tossed it to Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read that, will you, and tell me what he says,&rdquo; was his request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel read the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Office of
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B. Peixada &amp; Co.,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&mdash;Reade Street,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New York, Aug. 12, 1884.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir:&mdash;In view of the extraordinary occurrence of yesterday
      morning, I presume it is needless for me to say that your further services
      as my attorney can be dispensed with. Please have the goodness to transfer
      my brother&rsquo;s will and all other papers in your keeping, in reference to
      the case of my late sister-in-law, to Edwin Offenbach, Esq., attorney, No.&mdash;Broadway.
      I don&rsquo;t know if you expect me to pay you any more money; but if you do,
      please send memorandum to above address, and oblige,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Respectfully Yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B. Peixada.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A. Ripley, Esq., attorney, etc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants you to transfer his papers to another lawyer and render your
      bill, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is that all?&rdquo; Arthur rejoined. &ldquo;Well, then, let me have his note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur put Peixada&rsquo;s note into his pocket. The trio relapsed into their
      former silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again by and by the door-bell rang. Again all three started. Again Hetzel
      went to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur leaned forward, and strained his ears. He heard Hetzel take down
      the chain; he heard the door creak open; he heard a boy&rsquo;s voice, rough and
      lusty, say, &ldquo;No answer. Here, sign&mdash;will you?&rdquo; And then he sank back
      in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel staid away for some minutes. Coming back, &ldquo;It was the messenger,&rdquo;
       he said; &ldquo;but he had no answer. The prison people told him that there was
      none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now about seven o&rsquo;clock. Presently Bridget appeared upon the
      threshold, and asked to speak with her mistress. Mrs. Hart stepped into
      the hall, where for a time she and the servant conversed in low tones.
      Re-entering the parlor, she said, &ldquo;Dinner.&mdash;She came to tell me that
      dinner is ready. I had forgotten it. Will you come down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel rose. Arthur remained seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Arthur. Didn&rsquo;t you hear what Mrs. Hart said? Dinner is ready,&rdquo;
       Hetzel began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t suppose I want any dinner, do you? You two go down, if you
      choose. I&rsquo;ll wait for you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, be sensible, will you? Come down-stairs with us. Whether you want
      to, or not, you must eat something. You&rsquo;ll get sick, fasting like this.
      We&rsquo;ve got enough on our hands, as it is, without having a sick man to look
      after. Come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel took Arthur by the arm, and led him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      But their attempt at dinner was pretty doleful. Despite their long
      abstinence from food, none of them was hungry. Hetzel alone contrived to
      finish his soup. Mrs. Hart and Arthur could swallow no more than a few
      mouthfuls of bread and wine apiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterward they went back to the parlor. As before, Arthur sat still and
      nursed his thoughts. Hetzel picked up an illustrated book from the table,
      and began to turn the pages. Mrs. Hart said, &ldquo;If you will excuse me, I
      think I&rsquo;ll lie down for a little. I have a splitting headache.&rdquo; She lay
      down on the sofa. Hetzel got a shawl, and covered her with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock was striking ten, when for a third time the bell rang. For a
      third time Hetzel started to answer it. Arthur accompanied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel opened the door. A telegraph-boy confronted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ripley?&rdquo; the boy demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; said Arthur, and seized hold of the dispatch that the boy
      offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his courage forsook him. He turned white, and leaned against the wall
      for support.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some&mdash;something has happened to her,&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Read it for me,
      Hetz, and let me know the worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t from her. It&rsquo;s from Mr. Flint,&rdquo; said Hetzel, after he had
      read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; sighed Arthur.&mdash;&ldquo;Well, what does he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel put the telegram into Arthur&rsquo;s hands. Its contents were:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Victory! Meet me to-morrow morning, 10:30, at district-attorney&rsquo;s office.
      Every thing satisfactorily arranged. Absolutely nothing to fear.&mdash;Arthur
      Flint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; Hetzel added, &ldquo;now I hope you&rsquo;ll brace up a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I ought to,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;Anyhow, I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart was much relieved. Indeed, her spirits underwent a considerable
      reaction. Her eyes brightened, and she cried, &ldquo;Oh, to think! The dear
      child will be home again by luncheon-time to-morrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; put in Hetzel, &ldquo;I would counsel both you and Arthur to go to
      bed. A night&rsquo;s rest will work wonders for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think so, too,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Hart. &ldquo;But you&mdash;you will not
      leave us? You will sleep in our spare room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you. Yes, perhaps I&rsquo;d better stay here, so as to be on hand in
      case any thing should happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All three climbed the staircase. Mrs. Hart showed Hetzel to his quarters,
      and inspected them to satisfy herself that every thing was in proper order
      for his comfort. Then he escorted her back to her own bed-chamber. Arthur
      was standing in the hall. Mrs. Hart bade them both good night, and
      disappeared. Thereupon Hetzel, turning to Arthur, said, &ldquo;Now, old boy, go
      straight to bed, and refresh yourself with a sound sleep. Good-by till
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Arthur stopped him. In a voice that betrayed some embarrassment, he
      began, &ldquo;I say, Julian, I wonder whether you would very much mind my
      sleeping with you. You see, I&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t been in there&rdquo;&mdash;pointing
      to a door in front of them&mdash;&ldquo;since&mdash;since&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course. You don&rsquo;t feel like being left alone. I understand. Come
      on,&rdquo; said Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it. I don&rsquo;t feel like being left
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sky was overcast next morning, and a cold wind blew from across the
      river. Hetzel and Mrs. Hart were up betimes; but Arthur, who had tossed
      restlessly about for the earlier half of the night, lay abed till late. He
      did not show his face downstairs till nine o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want to start in about half an hour, Arthur,&rdquo; said Hetzel. &ldquo;That will
      give us time to stop at your office, before going to the
      district-attorney&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do we want to stop at my office for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to attend to the matters that Peixada wrote you about&mdash;return
      the will&mdash;and so forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. I had forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, I suppose, Mrs. Hart, that we shall be back here for luncheon, and
      bring Ruth with us. But if we shouldn&rsquo;t turn up till somewhat later, you
      mustn&rsquo;t alarm yourself. There&rsquo;s no telling how long the legal formalities
      may take.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak as though you were going to leave me behind,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I didn&rsquo;t think you would want to go with us. The weather is so
      threatening, and the district-attorney&rsquo;s office is so unpleasant a place,
      I took for granted that you would prefer to stay home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. I should go wild, waiting here alone. You must let me accompany
      you. I want to be the first&mdash;no, the second&mdash;to greet Ruth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel made no further opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went straight to Arthur&rsquo;s office. There he did the Peixada documents
      up in a bundle, directed the same to Mr. Edwin Offenbach, and told his
      office boy to deliver it to Mr. Offenbach in person. Then they proceeded
      on foot up Broadway and down Chambers Street to the district-attorney&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The identical lot of supercilious clerks with whom Hetzel had had it out
      the day before, were lolling about now in the ante-room. &ldquo;We wish to see
      Mr. Romer,&rdquo; Hetzel announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody seemed to be much impressed by this piece of intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, you fellow,&rdquo; Hetzel went on, addressing one young gentleman in
      particular, who appeared to have no more weighty duty to perform than the
      trimming of his finger-nails; &ldquo;just take that card into Mr. Romer&mdash;will
      you?&mdash;and look sharp about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman glanced up languidly, surveyed his interlocutor with a
      mingling of pity and amusement, at length drawled, &ldquo;Say, Jim, see what
      this party&rsquo;s after,&rdquo; and returned to his toilet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel&rsquo;s brow contracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to see Mr. Romer about?&rdquo; demanded Jim, leisurely lifting
      himself from the desk atop which he had been seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel&rsquo;s brows contracted a trifle more closely. There was an ugly look in
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I want to see Mr. Romer about?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain that
      to Mr. Romer. What I want you to do is to conduct us to Mr. Romer&rsquo;s
      office; and I want you to do that at short notice, or, I promise you, I&rsquo;ll
      find out the reason why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel had spoken quietly, but with an inflection that was unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, step this way, then, will you?&rdquo; said Jim, the least bit
      crestfallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      They followed him into Mr. Romer&rsquo;s private room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romer was seated at his desk. Mr. Flint was seated hard-by at a table,
      examining some papers. Both rose at the entrance of the visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Arthur, my dear boy,&rdquo; Mr. Flint exclaimed, &ldquo;here you are.&rdquo; He clapped
      his godson heartily upon the shoulder, and proceeded to pay his
      compliments to Mrs. Hart and Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do, Ripley?&rdquo; said Romer. &ldquo;Glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon befell a moment of silence. Nobody seemed to know what to say
      next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Mr. Flint began. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I ought to tell you that Mr.
      Romer is to be thanked for all the good luck that we have met with. Except
      for his intercession, Mr. Orson would not have considered the bail
      question for a moment. As it is, Mr. Romer has persuaded him&mdash;But
      perhaps you&rsquo;d better go on,&rdquo; he added, abruptly turning to Romer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Romer, &ldquo;the long and short of it is that Mr. Orson agrees to
      accept bail in twenty-five thousand dollars. You know, Ripley, it&rsquo;s our
      rule not to take bail at all in cases of this sort; and so he had to fix a
      large amount to ward off scandal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here are the papers, all ready to be signed,&rdquo; said Mr. Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Hetzel began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, just so. I was coming to that,&rdquo; Romer interposed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve sent for
      her, and she&rsquo;ll get here before long. But what I was going to say is this:
      Mr. Orson makes it a condition that before bail is accepted, she be
      required to&mdash;to plead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; queried Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, she must put in her plea of not guilty in&mdash;in open
      court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Arthur. &ldquo;Subject her to that humiliation? Drag her up to the
      bar of a crowded court-room, and&mdash;and&mdash;Oh, it will kill her! You
      might as well kill her outright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this absolutely necessary?&rdquo; asked Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Orson made it a <i>sine qua non</i>,&rdquo; replied Romer; &ldquo;and if you&rsquo;ll
      listen to me for a moment, I&rsquo;ll tell you why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, gnawed his mustache for an instant, at length resumed, &ldquo;You
      know, Ripley, we never should have gone at this case, at all, except for
      you. That&rsquo;s so, isn&rsquo;t it? All right. Now, what I want to make plain is
      that we&rsquo;re, not to blame. You started us, didn&rsquo;t you? Well and good. We
      unearthed that old indictment, which otherwise might have lain moldering
      in its pigeon-hole till the day of doom, we unearthed it simply because
      you urged us to. We never should have moved in the matter, except for you.
      I want you to confess that this is a true statement of the facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; groaned Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Ripley. That&rsquo;s just what I wanted to bring out. Now I can pass
      on to point two. Point two is this. I suppose you&rsquo;re very sorry for what&rsquo;s
      happened. I know we are&mdash;at least, I am&mdash;awfully sorry. And
      what&rsquo;s more, I feel&mdash;I feel&mdash;hang it, I feel uncommonly friendly
      toward you, Ripley, old boy. Don&rsquo;t you understand? I want to do all I can
      to get you out of this confounded mess. And so, what I went to work to do
      with Mr. Orson was not only to induce him to take bail, but also, don&rsquo;t
      you see, to get him to drop the case. What I urged upon him was this. I
      said, &rsquo;Look here, Mr. Orson, we didn&rsquo;t start this business, did we? Then
      why the deuce should we press it? The chances of conviction aren&rsquo;t great,
      and anyhow we&rsquo;ve got our hands full enough, without raking up worm-eaten
      indictments. I say, as long as she has turned out to be who she is, I say,
      let&rsquo;s leave matters in <i>statu quo</i>.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what I said to Mr.
      Orson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, Romer, you&mdash;you&rsquo;re a brick,&rdquo; was the most Arthur could
      respond. There was a frog in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; Romer continued, &ldquo;I put it before Mr. Orson in that shape,
      and I argued with him a long time about it. But what struck him was this.
      &rsquo;What&rsquo;ll the public say?&rsquo; he asked. &rsquo;Now it&rsquo;s got into the papers,
      there&rsquo;ll be the dickens to pay, if we don&rsquo;t push it.&rsquo; And you can&rsquo;t deny,
      Ripley, that that&rsquo;s a pretty serious difficulty. Well, he and I, we talked
      it over, and considered the pros and cons, and the upshot of it was that
      he said, &rsquo;All right, Romer. I have no desire to carry the matter further
      than is necessary to set us right before the public. So, what I&rsquo;ll consent
      to do is to have bail fixed in a large sum&mdash;say twenty-five thousand
      dollars&mdash;and then she must plead in open court. That&rsquo;ll satisfy the
      reporters. Then we&rsquo;ll put the indictment back into the safe, and let it
      lie. As long as we&rsquo;re solid with the public, I don&rsquo;t care.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what
      Mr. Orson said. So now, you see, she&rsquo;s got to plead in open court, to
      prevent the newspapers from raising Cain with us, and the bail&rsquo;s got to be
      pretty considerable for the same reason. But after that&rsquo;s settled, you can
      take her home, and rest easy. As long as we&rsquo;re in office the charge won&rsquo;t
      be revived; and by the time we&rsquo;re superseded, it will be an old story and
      forgotten by all hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Mr. Flint said, &ldquo;how much we have to thank Mr. Romer for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I hope Mr. Romer will believe that we appreciate his kindness,&rdquo; added
      Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;God bless you, Romer,&rdquo; blurted out Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Romer, &ldquo;to come down to particulars, we&rsquo;ve got a crowded
      calendar to-day, and so the court room is likely to be full of people. I
      wanted to make this pleading business as easy as possible for her, and on
      that account I&rsquo;ve sent an officer after her already. Just as soon as the
      judge arrives, she can put in her plea. Then we&rsquo;ll all come back here, and
      have the papers signed; and then you can go home and be happy. Now, if
      you&rsquo;ll follow me, I&rsquo;ll take you into the court room by the side entrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to go into the court room. I couldn&rsquo;t stand it.
      Let us wait here till it&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; whimpered Arthur, through chattering
      teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romer looked surprised. &ldquo;Just as you please,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but prisoners
      generally like to see a friendly face near them, when they&rsquo;re called up to
      plead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ripley doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s saying,&rdquo; put in Hetzel. &ldquo;Of course we will
      follow you into court.&rdquo; In a lower tone, turning to Arthur, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
      mean that you want her to go through that ordeal alone, do you?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I forgot about that,&rdquo; Arthur confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but,&rdquo; asked Mrs. Hart, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t we see her and speak to her
      before she has to appear in court?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that could be managed,&rdquo; replied Romer, &ldquo;without some delay.
      You know, I want to have her plead the moment she gets here, so as to
      avoid the crush. It&rsquo;ll only take a few minutes. You&rsquo;d better come now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They followed Romer out of his office, down a long, gloomy corridor, along
      which knots of people stood, chatting and smoking rank cigars, and into
      the General Sessions court room&mdash;the court room that Arthur had
      visited a few months before, out of idle curiosity to witness the scene of
      Mrs. Peixada&rsquo;s trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were already about forty persons present: a half dozen lawyers at
      the counsel-table, busy with books and papers; a larger number of
      respectable looking citizens, who read newspapers and appeared bored&mdash;probably
      gentlemen of the jury; and a residue of damp, dirty, dismal individuals,
      including a few tattered women, who were doubtless, like those with whom
      we are chiefly concerned, come to watch the fate of some unfortunate
      friend. Every body kept very still, so that the big clock on the wall made
      itself distinctly heard even to the farthest corner of the room. Its hands
      marked five minutes to eleven. The suspense was painful. It seemed to
      Arthur that he had grown a year older in the interval that elapsed before
      the clock solemnly tolled the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romer had chairs placed for them within the bar, a little to the right of
      the clerk&rsquo;s desk, so that they would not be more than six feet distant
      from the prisoner, when she stood up to speak. Then he left them, saying,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see whether the judge has got down. I want to ask him to go on the
      bench promptly, as a favor to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterward a loud rapping sounded upon the door that led from the
      corridor, and the officers who were scattered about the room,
      simultaneously called, &ldquo;Hats off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge, with grave and rather self-conscious mien, stalked past our
      friends, and took his position on the bench. Romer followed at a few
      paces. He smiled at Arthur, and crossed over to the district-attorney&rsquo;s
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a breathing space of silence. Then the crier rose, and sang out
      his time-honored admonition, &ldquo;Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, all persons
      having business with this court,&rdquo; etc., to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another moment of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk untied a bundle of papers, ran them over, got upon his feet, and
      exchanged a few whispered words with the judge. Eventually he turned
      around and faced the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, how still Arthur&rsquo;s heart stood, as the clerk cried, in rasping,
      metallic accents, &ldquo;Judith Peixada, alias Ruth Ripley, to the bar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were by this time quite seventy-five spectators present. Every one
      of them leaned forward on his chair, and craned his neck eagerly, to catch
      a good glimpse of the prisoner. In the distance, somewhere, resounded a
      harsh click (as of a key turned in a stiff lock), succeeded by a violent
      clang (as of an iron door opened and slammed to, in haste). Then, up the
      aisle leading from the rear of the court room, advanced the figure of a
      lady, dressed in black. She had to run the gauntlet of those seventy-five
      on-lookers, more than one of whom was bold enough to obtrude himself upon
      her path, and stare her squarely in the face. She had no veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she marched bravely on, looking fixedly ahead, and at last reached the
      railing where she had to halt. She was terribly pale. Her features were
      hard and peaked. Her under-lip was pressed tight beneath her teeth. Her
      face might have been of marble. It contrasted sharply with the black hair
      above it, and the black gown underneath. Her eyes were empty of
      expression, like those of one who is blind. She appeared not to see her
      friends: at any rate, she gave them no sign of recognition. Yet they were
      only a few feet away, and almost exactly in front of her. She stood
      motionless, with both hands resting on the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      What must have been Arthur Ripley&rsquo;s feelings at this moment, as he beheld
      his wife, standing within arm&rsquo;s reach of him, a prisoner in a court of
      law, prey to a hundred devouring eyes, and recognized his utter
      helplessness to interfere and shield her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judith Peixada, alias Ruth Ripley,&rdquo; began the clerk, in the same
      mechanical, metallic voice, &ldquo;you have been indicted for murder in the
      first degree upon the person of Edward Bolen, late of the first ward of
      the City of New York, deceased, and against the peace of the People of the
      State of New York, and their dignity. How say you, are you guilty or not
      guilty of the felony as stated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner&rsquo;s hands clutched tightly at the railing. She drew a deep
      breath. Her pale lips parted. So low that only those within a radius of a
      yard or two could hear, she said, &ldquo;I am guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk assumed that he had misunderstood. &ldquo;Come, speak up louder,&rdquo; he
      said, roughly. &ldquo;How do you plead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A spasm contracted the prisoner&rsquo;s features, She bit her lip. Her hands
      shook violently. She repeated, &ldquo;I plead guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk&rsquo;s face betrayed a small measure of surprise. Speedily
      controlling it, however, he began to recite the formula, for such case,
      made and provided: &ldquo;You answer that you are guilty of the felony as
      charged in the indictment, and so your plea shall stand record&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Mr. Clerk,&rdquo; the judge at this point interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flint and Hetzel were looking into each other&rsquo;s faces with blank
      consternation. Arthur&rsquo;s head had dropped forward upon his breast. Mrs.
      Hart sprang to her feet, ran toward the prisoner, grasped her arm, and
      cried out, &ldquo;Oh, it is not true. You don&rsquo;t know what you have said, Ruth.
      It is not true&mdash;she is not guilty, sir,&rdquo; directing the last words at
      the clerk. The on-lookers shifted in their seats and conversed together.
      The court-officers hammered with their gavels and commanded, &ldquo;Order&mdash;silence.&rdquo;
       Mr. Romer stood up, and tried to catch the judge&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Mr. Clerk,&rdquo; the judge had said; then addressing himself to
      the culprit, &ldquo;The plea that you offer, Judith Peixada, ought not, in the
      opinion of the court, to be accepted. The penalty for murder in the first
      degree is fixed by law, and that penalty is hanging. No discretionary
      alternative is left to the magistrate. Therefore to permit you to enter a
      plea of guilty of murder in the first degree, would be to permit
      self-destruction. It has never been the custom of our courts to accept
      that plea; though, naturally, they have seldom enough had occasion to
      decline it. If I remember rightly, the Connecticut tribunals have in one
      or two instances allowed that plea to be recorded; but, unless I am
      misinformed, the statutes of Connecticut empower the sentencing officer to
      choose between death and imprisonment for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can not consistently and conscientiously violate our precedents, and
      for that reason I must decline to entertain the plea that you have
      offered. If, however, you are in your heart persuaded of your guilt, and
      wish to spare the People the expense and labor of a trial before a jury, I
      will accept a plea of murder in the second degree, the punishment for
      which, I must beg you to recollect, is confinement at hard labor in the
      State Prison for the term of your natural life. The clerk will now put the
      question to you, Judith Peixada, and you are at full liberty to reply to
      it as you deem fit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the court please,&rdquo; said Romer, &ldquo;I should like to make a brief
      statement, before these proceedings are continued.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the judge. &ldquo;You can wait, Mr. Clerk, until we have heard
      from the district-attorney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every man and woman in the court-room, save only two, strained forward to
      catch each syllable that Romer might pronounce. The two exceptions were
      the prisoner and her husband. He sat huddled up in his chair, apparently
      deaf and blind to what was going on around. She leaned heavily upon the
      railing in front of her, and the expression in her eyes was one of weary
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you kindly see that a chair is furnished the prisoner?&rdquo; Romer asked
      of the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      An attendant brought a chair. The prisoner sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your honor please,&rdquo; said Romer, &ldquo;I desire to state that, in case the
      prisoner be allowed to plead to murder in the second degree, it will be
      against the protest of the People. The evidence in support of the
      indictment is of such a nature as to admit of doubt concerning the
      prisoner&rsquo;s guilt; and, if it were submitted to a jury, I think the chances
      would be even whether they would acquit her or convict her. The People
      feel that there is evidence enough to justify a trial, but they are
      reluctant to&mdash;become accessories to what, in their judgment, may be
      the hasty act of an ill-advised woman. It is the duty of the
      district-attorney to endeavor to secure a conviction&mdash;it would be his
      duty to consent to a plea&mdash;when fully convinced in his own mind of
      the accused person&rsquo;s legal guilt. But when he is doubtful, or at least not
      entirely satisfied, of that guilt, as I confess to being in the case at
      bar, it is his duty to submit the question for arbitration to a jury.
      That, your honor, is the stand which I am compelled to take in these
      premises. I entertain grave doubts of the prisoner&rsquo;s guilt&mdash;doubts
      which could only be set at rest by a verdict rendered in the regular way.
      I protest therefore against the entry of a plea such as your honor has
      suggested; and, if the court please, I desire that this protest on the
      part of the People be made a matter of record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flint and Hetzel breathed more freely. Mrs. Hart fanned herself with
      manifest agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge replied: &ldquo;The clerk will procure a transcript of the
      district-attorney&rsquo;s remarks from the stenographer, and enter the same in
      the minutes. In response to those remarks, I feel called upon to say that
      it is to be presumed that the prisoner at the bar, better than any one
      else, is competent to decide upon the question of her own guilt or
      innocence. She certainly can not be in doubt as to whether she committed
      the felony charged against her. The court has already enlightened her
      respecting the sentence that will be imposed in the event of her pleading
      guilty of murder in the second degree. Whatever evidence might be adduced
      in her behalf at a trial, is certainly not to be weighed against her own
      voluntary and unconstrained confession. It would be contrary to public
      policy and to good morals for the court to seal the prisoner&rsquo;s lips, as
      the district-attorney appears anxious to have it do. The clerk will now
      put the necessary inquiries to her; and if she elect to offer the plea in
      debate, the court will feel obliged to accept it.&rdquo; Romer bowed and sat
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk forthwith proceeded to business. &ldquo;Judith Peixada, stand up,&rdquo; he
      ordered. Upon her obeying, he rattled off, &ldquo;Judith Peixada, do you desire
      to withdraw your plea of guilty of murder in the first degree, and to
      substitute for the same a plea of guilty of murder in the second degree,
      as charged in the second count of the indictment? If so, say, &rsquo;I do.&rsquo;.rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart cried, &ldquo;No, no! She does not. Don&rsquo;t you see that the child is
      sick? How should she know whether she is guilty or not? Oh, it will be
      monstrous if you allow her to say that she is guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order! Silence!&rdquo; called the officers. One of them seized Mrs. Hart&rsquo;s arm
      and pushed her into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner&rsquo;s lips moved. &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You answer,&rdquo; went on the clerk, &ldquo;that you are guilty of the felony of
      murder in the second degree, as charged in the second count of the
      indictment; and so your plea shall stand recorded. What have you now to
      say why sentence should not be pronounced upon you according to law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Romer stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your honor please,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the People are not yet prepared to move
      for sentence. In the absence of counsel for the prisoner, I must take it
      upon myself to request that sentence be suspended for at least one week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The court suspends sentence till this day week at eleven o&rsquo;clock in the
      forenoon,&rdquo; said the judge; &ldquo;and meanwhile the prisoner is remanded to the
      city prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner was at once led away.

      CHAPTER X.&mdash;&ldquo;SICK OF A FEVER.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>OMER drew near to
      Mr. Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did all I could,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things look pretty desperate now, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; Mr. Flint returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel tugged at his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart started up. &ldquo;Oh, for mercy&rsquo;s sake, Mr. Romer, you are not going
      to let them take her back to&mdash;to that place, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I can help it. Bail is out of the question, after what
      has happened, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can&rsquo;t I see her and speak to her just a moment, first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly; you can do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Romer stepped aside and spoke to an officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; he said, returning, &ldquo;they have already carried her off.
      But you can drive right down behind her.&mdash;Hello! What&rsquo;s the matter
      with Ripley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked around toward Arthur. A glance showed them that he had
      fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did this happen?&rdquo; asked Romer.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one could tell. No one had paid the slightest attention to Arthur,
      since the prisoner had first appeared in court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we must get him out of here right away,&rdquo; said Romer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flint and Hetzel lent a hand apiece; and his three friends carried the
      unhappy man out of the room, of course thereby creating a new sensation
      among the spectators. They bore him along the corridor, and into Mr.
      Romer&rsquo;s office, where they laid him upon a sofa. Romer touched a bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to send some one to take my place in court,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the subordinate who appeared, &ldquo;Ask Mr. Birdsall to step here,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Birdsall came, received Romer&rsquo;s orders, departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, now,&rdquo; said Romer, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got that off my hands. Now, let&rsquo;s bring
      him around. Luckily, I have a flask of brandy in my desk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rubbed some brandy upon Arthur&rsquo;s temples, and poured a drop or two
      between his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fan him, will you?&rdquo; he asked of Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart proffered her fan. Hetzel took it, and fanned Arthur&rsquo;s face
      vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart looked on for a moment in silence. At length she said, &ldquo;Well, I
      can&rsquo;t wait here. I am going to the prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to be sure; I had forgotten,&rdquo; said Romer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send a man to obtain
      admittance for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I also bear you company?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart replied, &ldquo;That is very kind of you. I should like very much to
      have you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Romer rang his bell for a second time. A negro answered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert,&rdquo; said Romer, &ldquo;go with this lady and gentleman to the Tombs, and
      tell the warden that they are special friends of mine, and that I shall
      thank him to show them every courtesy in his power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he returned to the sofa, on which Arthur still lay inanimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No progress?&rdquo; he demanded of Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None. Can you send for a physician? Is there one near by?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A third stroke of the bell. Hetzel&rsquo;s acquaintance, Jim, entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run right over to Chambers Street Hospital, and tell them we want a
      doctor up here at once,&rdquo; was Romer&rsquo;s behest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friend&rsquo;s in a pretty bad way,&rdquo; he continued to Hetzel. &ldquo;And, by Jove,
      his wife must be a maniac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at him,&rdquo; said Hetzel. &ldquo;I feel rather used up myself, after
      that strain in court. But her conduct is certainly incomprehensible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea of pleading guilty, when I had things fixed up so neatly! She
      must be stark, raving mad. Insanity, by the way, was her defense at the
      former trial. I guess it was a <i>bona fide</i> one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt of it. But I suppose it&rsquo;s too late to make that claim now&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      it?&mdash;now that the judge has ordered her plea of guilty to be
      recorded. Yet&mdash;yet it isn&rsquo;t possible that she will really have to go
      to prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might have a commission appointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, a commission to inquire into, and report upon, her sanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might? We will. That&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;ll do. But how? What are the
      necessary steps to take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, when she&rsquo;s brought up for sentence, next week, and asked what she
      has to say, and so forth, you have an attorney on hand, and let him
      declare his conviction, based upon affidavits, that she&rsquo;s a lunatic, and
      then move that sentence be suspended pending the investigation of her
      sanity by a commission to be appointed by the court&mdash;understand? Our
      side won&rsquo;t oppose, and the judge will grant the motion as a matter of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes; I see.&mdash;Mercy upon me, I never knew a fainting fit to last
      so long as this; did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not much posted on fainting-fits in general, but it&rsquo; does seem
      as though this was an uncommonly lengthy one, to be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur&rsquo;s face betrayed no sign of vitality except for the gentle flutter
      of his nostrils as his breath came and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow,&rdquo; mused Romer, &ldquo;what an infernal pickle he&rsquo;s gone and got
      himself into! It&rsquo;s the strangest coincidence I ever heard of. There he
      was, pegging away at that case month after month, and never suspecting
      that the lady in question was his wife! And she&mdash;she never told him.
      Queer, ain t it? As far as we were concerned, we never should have lifted
      a finger, only I was anxious to do Ripley a good turn. He&rsquo;s a nice fellow,
      is Ripley, and I always liked him and his father before him. That&rsquo;s why we
      took this business up&mdash;just for the sake of giving him a lift, you
      know. As for his client, old Peixada, we&rsquo;d have seen him hanged before
      we&rsquo;d have troubled ourselves about his affairs&mdash;except, as I say, for
      Ripley&rsquo;s sake. And now, this is what comes of it. Well, Ripley never was
      cut out for a lawyer anyhow. He had too many notions, and didn&rsquo;t take
      things practically enough. Why, when the question of advertising first
      came up, he was as squeamish about it, and made as much fuss, as if he&rsquo;d
      known all the time who she was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the doctor, sir,&rdquo; cried Jim, entering at this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim was followed by a young gentleman in uniform, who, without waiting to
      hear the history of the case, at once approached the sofa, and began to
      exercise his craft. He undid Arthur&rsquo;s cravat, unbuttoned his shirt collar,
      placed one hand upon his forehead, and with the other hand felt his pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open all the windows, please,&rdquo; he said in a quiet, business-like tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid his ear upon the patient&rsquo;s breast, and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did this begin?&rdquo; he asked at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say about half an hour ago,&rdquo; Romer answered, looking at his
      watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;is there any occasion for anxiety?&rdquo; Hetzel inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell yet,&rdquo; was his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a leather wallet from his pocket, and unclasping it, disclosed an
      array of tiny glass phials. One of these he extracted, and holding it up
      to the light, called for a glass of water. Romer brought the water. The
      doctor poured a few drops of medicine from his phial into the tumbler. The
      water thereupon clouded and became opaque. Dipping his finger into it, the
      doctor proceeded to moisten Arthur&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Each of you gentlemen please take one of his hands,&rdquo; said the doctor,
      &ldquo;and chafe it till it gets warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Romer and Hetzel obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want him taken to the hospital?&rdquo; the doctor inquired presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Hetzel. &ldquo;As soon as he is able, we want to take him home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does he live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Beekman Place&mdash;Fiftieth Street and the East River.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; muttered the doctor, dubiously; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s quite a distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. But after he comes to, and gets rested, he won&rsquo;t mind it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, do you mean that that he&rsquo;s going to be seriously sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless I&rsquo;m mistaken, he&rsquo;s going to lie abed for the next six weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh-h-h! Not so loud. Yes, I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s in for a long illness. As for
      taking him to Beekman Place, if you&rsquo;re bound to do it, we must have an
      ambulance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think if he&rsquo;s got to be sick, he&rsquo;d better be sick at home. What is it
      necessary to do, to procure an ambulance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send for one.&mdash;Can you let me have a messenger?&rdquo; he asked of
      Romer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romer summoned Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor wrote a few lines on a prescription blank, and instructed Jim
      to deliver it to the house-surgeon at the hospital. Returning to Arthur&rsquo;s
      side, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s beginning to come around,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and now, I think, you
      gentlemen had better leave the room. He mustn&rsquo;t open his mouth for some
      time; and if his friends are near him when he recovers consciousness, he
      might want to talk. So, please leave me alone with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t fail to call us if&mdash;if&mdash;&rdquo; Hetzel hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t be afraid. There&rsquo;s no immediate danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find us in the next room,&rdquo; said Romer, and led Hetzel out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whom should they run against in the passageway but Mrs. Hart and Mr.
      Flint?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Back so soon?&rdquo; Romer exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She refused to see me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romer pushed open a door. &ldquo;Sit down in here,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Arthur?&rdquo; asked Mr. Flint. &ldquo;How is he getting on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Romer explained Arthur&rsquo;s situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse and worse,&rdquo; cried Mr. Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how was it that she refused to see you?&rdquo; Hetzel questioned,
      addressing Mrs. Hart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sent me this,&rdquo; Mrs. Hart replied, holding out a sheet of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel took it and read:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear one:&mdash;It will seem most ungracious and ungrateful of me to
      send word that I can not see you just now, and yet that is what I am
      compelled to do. My only excuse is that I am writing something which
      demands the utmost concentration and self-possession that I can command;
      and if I should set eyes upon the face I love so well, I should lose all
      control of myself. It is very hard to be obliged to say this to you; but
      what I am writing is of great importance&mdash;to me, at least&mdash;and
      the sight of you would agitate me so much that I could not finish it. Oh,
      my dear, kind friend, will you forgive me? If you could come to see me
      to-morrow, it would be a great comfort. Then my writing will be done with.
      I love you with all my heart, and thank you for all your goodness to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame her too severely, Mrs. Hart,&rdquo; said Hetzel. &ldquo;She is probably
      half-distracted, and scarcely knows what she is doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t blame her,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Hart; &ldquo;only&mdash;only&mdash;it was
      a little hard to be denied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any idea what it is that she is writing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the remotest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is an explanation of her conduct today in court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flint said, &ldquo;Well, Mr. Romer, the bright plans that we were making
      last night have been knocked in the head, haven&rsquo;t they? But I won&rsquo;t
      believe that there isn&rsquo;t some way out of our troubles, in spite of all. It
      isn&rsquo;t seriously possible that she&rsquo;ll be sentenced to prison, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I was suggesting to Mr. Hetzel, a while ago, her friends might claim
      that she&rsquo;s insane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, insane she must be, in point of fact. A lady like Mrs. Ripley&mdash;to
      plead guilty of murder&mdash;why, of course, she&rsquo;s insane. It&rsquo;s absurd on
      its face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t any of you happen to be posted on the circumstances of the
      case, do you?&rdquo; Romer asked. &ldquo;I mean her side of the story. I&rsquo;m familiar
      with the other side myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know absolutely nothing about it,&rdquo; said Mr. Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I know,&rdquo; said Hetzel, &ldquo;is what Arthur has let drop in conversation,
      from time to time, during the last few months. But then, you know, he was
      looking at it from the point of view of the prosecution. I should imagine
      that if any one would understand the true inwardness of the matter, it
      would be Mrs. Hart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart said, &ldquo;I know that she is as innocent as the babe at its
      mother&rsquo;s breast. When she and I first met each other, in England, two
      years ago, and became friends, she told me all about it; but it was a long
      and complicated story, and I can&rsquo;t remember it clearly enough to repeat
      it. You see, I always regarded it as a dark bygone that had best be
      forgotten. I believe that as far as the mere bodily act went, she did fire
      off the pistol that killed her husband and that other man. But there were
      some circumstances that cleared her of all responsibility, though I can&rsquo;t
      recall exactly what they were. But it wasn&rsquo;t that she was insane. She
      never was insane. I think she said her lawyers defended her on that plea
      when she was tried; but she insisted that she was not insane, and
      explained it in some other way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that don&rsquo;t signify,&rdquo; said Romer. &ldquo;When defendants really are insane,
      they invariably fancy that they&rsquo;re not, and get highly indignant at their
      counsel for maintaining that they are. At any rate, lunacy is what you
      must fight for now. As I told Mr. Hetzel, you want to retain a lawyer, and
      have him move for a commission when the case comes up next week. You&rsquo;ll
      have your motion granted on application, because we shan&rsquo;t oppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in the event of the commission declaring her to be insane?&rdquo; queried
      Mr. Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, her plea will be rendered null and void.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in case they say that she&rsquo;s of sound mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be the devil to pay. Sentence will have to be passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she will&mdash;will actually&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about that. The chances are that they will report as you
      wish. And if they shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;if worse came to worst&mdash;why,
      there&rsquo;s the governor, who has power to pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ambulance has arrived,&rdquo; said the doctor, coming into the room. &ldquo;Some
      one had better run on ahead, and get a bed ready for the patient. Please,
      also, prepare plenty of chopped ice, and have some towels handy, and a
      bottle of hot water for his feet. By the way, you didn&rsquo;t give me the
      number of the house. How&rsquo;s that? No. 46? Thanks. We&rsquo;ll drive slowly, so as
      not to shake him up; and consequently you&rsquo;ll have time enough to get there
      first, and make every thing ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hetzel, rising, &ldquo;good-by, Mr. Romer, and I trust that you
      know how grateful we are to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Romer. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the street Mr. Flint said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll invite myself to go home with you. I
      want to see how badly off the poor boy is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Beekman Place they made the &rsquo;arrangements, that the doctor had
      indicated for Arthur&rsquo;s reception, and then sat down in the drawing-room to
      await his coming. By and by the ambulance rolled up to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hurried out upon the stoop. A good many of the neighbors had come to
      their windows, and there was a small army of inquisitive children
      bivouacked upon the curbstone. Mrs. Berle ran across from her house, and
      talked excitedly to Mrs. Hart. Of course, all Beekman Place had read in
      the newspapers of Judith Peixada&rsquo;s arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, assisted by the driver, lifted the sick man out. He lay at
      full length upon a canvas stretcher. His face had assumed a cadaverous,
      greenish tinge. His big blue eyes, wide open, were fixed upon the empty
      air above them. To all appearances, he was still unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      They carried him up the stoop; through the hall, and into the room
      above-stairs to which Mrs. Hart conducted them. There they laid him on the
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;first of all, send for your own physician. I must
      see him and confer with him, before I go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart left the room, to obey the doctor&rsquo;s injunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Jake,&rdquo; the doctor went on, addressing the driver, &ldquo;needn&rsquo;t wait.
      Drive back to the hospital, and tell them that I&rsquo;ll come as soon as I can
      be spared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Jake, before you go,&rdquo; said Mr. Flint, producing his purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thanks. Can&rsquo;t accept any thing, sir,&rdquo; responded Jake, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, gentlemen,&rdquo; resumed the doctor, &ldquo;just lend a hand, and help undress
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Following the doctor&rsquo;s directions, they got the patient out of his
      clothes. He seemed to be a mere limp, inert mass of flesh, and displayed
      no symptoms of realizing what was going on. His extremities were ice-cold.
      His forehead was hot. His breath was labored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very sick man, I&rsquo;m afraid, isn&rsquo;t he, doctor?&rdquo; asked Mr. Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor covered him with the bed-clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think is the matter with him?&rdquo; Mr. Flint pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it hasn&rsquo;t developed sufficiently yet to be classified. His mind must
      have been undergoing a strain for some time, I guess; and now he&rsquo;s broken
      down beneath it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s quite unconscious, apparently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in a sort of lethargy. That&rsquo;s what makes the case a puzzle. Won&rsquo;t
      you order a hot-water bottle, somebody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel left the room. In a moment he brought the bottle of hot water. The
      doctor applied it to Arthur&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the chopped ice?&rdquo; Hetzel inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor placed his hand upon Arthur&rsquo;s brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N&mdash;no; we won&rsquo;t use the chopped ice yet a while,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by a bell rang down-stairs. A little later Mrs. Hart came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our doctor&mdash;Dr. Letzup&mdash;is here,&rdquo; she announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Letzup entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you medical men would like to be left alone?&rdquo; said Mr. Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I guess so,&rdquo; said the hospital-doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart led the way into the adjoining room. There our friends
      maintained a melancholy silence. Mrs. Hart&rsquo;s cats slept comfortably, one
      upon the sofa, the other upon the rug before the mantelpiece. The voices
      of the two physicians, in earnest conversation, were audible through the
      closed door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Mr. Hart jumped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what now?&rdquo; Mr. Flint questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard one of them step into the hall. Perhaps they need something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hurried to the threshold. There she confronted the hospital-doctor. He
      had his hand raised, as if on the point of rapping for admittance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I was looking for you,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I am going now. I don&rsquo;t see
      that I can be of any further use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Arthur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About as he was. Dr. Letzup has taken charge of him. Well, good day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you shan&rsquo;t leave us in this way,&rdquo; protested Mrs. Hart. &ldquo;You must at
      least wait and let me offer you a glass of wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;but they are expecting me in
      Chambers Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hart, flanked by Mr. Flint and Hetzel, accompanied him to the
      vestibule. All three did their utmost to thank him adequately for the
      pains he had taken in their behalf. Returning up-stairs, they were joined
      by Dr. Letzup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, doctor?&rdquo; began Mrs. Hart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Hart,&rdquo; the doctor replied, &ldquo;our friend in the next room has
      been exciting himself lately, hasn&rsquo;t he? What he wants now is a trained
      nurse, soothing medicines, and perfect quiet. The first two I&rsquo;m going to
      send around, as soon as I leave the house. For the last, he must depend
      upon you. That is equivalent to saying that he will have it. Therefore, so
      far as I can see, you have every reason to be hopeful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you take his trouble to be, doctor?&rdquo; asked Hetzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know of any special name for it,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;The poor
      fellow must have been careless of himself recently&mdash;worrying,
      probably, about something&mdash;and then came a shock of one kind or
      another&mdash;collapse of stock he&rsquo;d been investing in, or what not&mdash;and
      so he went under. We&rsquo;ll fetch him up again, fast enough. The main thing is
      to steer him clear of brain fever. I think we can do it. If it turns out
      that we can&rsquo;t&mdash;if the fever should develop&mdash;then, we&rsquo;ll go to
      work and pilot him safely through it. Now I must be off. Some one had
      better stay with him till the nurse comes. Keep him warm&mdash;hot water
      at his feet, you know, and bed-clothes tucked in about his shoulders. When
      the nurse turns up, she&rsquo;ll give him his medicines. I&rsquo;ll call again after
      dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flint left a little later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I shan&rsquo;t be of any assistance, but merely in the way, by
      remaining here. So I&rsquo;ll go home. But of course you&rsquo;ll notify me instantly
      if there should be a change for the worse,&rdquo; was his valedictory.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner the doctor called, pursuant to his promise. Having visited
      his patient, and held an interview with the nurse, he beckoned Hetzel to
      one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s going to be brain
      fever, after all. He&rsquo;s a little delirious just now, and his temperature is
      higher than I should like. The nurse will take perfect care of him. You&rsquo;d
      better go to bed early and sleep well, so as to be fresh and able to
      relieve her in the morning. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did the doctor say to you?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Hart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel told her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.&mdash;&ldquo;HOW SHE ENDEAVORED TO EXPLAIN HER LIFE.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HURSDAY morning it
      rained. Hetzel was seated in Mrs. Hart&rsquo;s dining-room, making such an
      apology for a breakfast as, under the circumstances, could be expected of
      him, when the waitress announced that Josephine was in the kitchen, and
      wished to speak with her master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Hetzel; &ldquo;ask her to step this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Josephine presented herself. Not without some embarrassment, she declared
      that she had heard what rumor had to say of Mrs. Ripley&rsquo;s imprisonment and
      of Mr. Ripley&rsquo;s sickness, and that she was anxious to learn the very truth
      of the matter from Hetzel&rsquo;s lips. Hetzel replied good-naturedly to her
      interrogations; and at length Josephine rose to go her way. But having
      attained the door, she halted and faced about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ach Gott!</i>&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I was forgetting about these.&rdquo; She drew
      a bunch of letters from her pocket, and deposited them upon the table
      beside Hetzel&rsquo;s plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone, Hetzel picked the letters up, and began to study their
      superscriptions. One by one, he threw them aside without breaking their
      seals, till at last &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;who has been writing a book for me
      to read? Half an inch thick, as I&rsquo;m alive; looks like a lady&rsquo;s hand, too;
      seems somehow as though I recognized it. Let me see.&mdash;Ah! I remember.
      It must be from <i>her!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without further preliminary, he pushed back his chair, tore the envelope
      open, and set out to read the missive through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Mr. Hetzel: I received a very kind note from you last night, and I
      should have answered it at once, only I had so much to say that I thought
      it would be better to wait till morning, in order to begin and finish it
      at a sitting. The lights are turned off here at nine o&rsquo;clock: and
      therefore if I had begun to write last evening, I should have been
      interrupted in the midst of it; and that would have rendered doubly
      difficult what in itself is difficult enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have much to explain, much to justify, much to ask forgiveness for. I
      am going to bring myself to say things to you, which, a few days ago, I
      believed it would be impossible for me to say to any living being, except
      my husband; and it would have been no easy matter to say them to him. But
      a great change has happened in the last few days. Now I can not say those
      things to my husband&mdash;never can. Now my wretched failure of a life is
      nearly ended. I am going to a prison where, I know very well, I shall not
      survive a great while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And something, which there is no need to analyze, impels me to put in
      writing such an explanation of what I have done and left undone in this
      world, as I may be able to make. Perhaps I am prompted to this course by
      pride, or if you choose, by vanity. However that may be, I do feel that in
      justice to myself as well as to my friends, I ought to try to state the
      head and front of my offending so as to soften the judgment that people
      aware only of my outward acts, and ignorant of my inner motives, would be
      disposed to pass upon me. I have ventured to address myself to you,
      instead of to Mrs. Hart, out of consideration for her. It would be too
      hard for her to have to read this writing through. You, having read it,
      can repeat its upshot to her in such a manner as to make it easier for her
      to bear. I know that you will be willing to do this, because I know that
      both she and I have always had a friend in you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my own assistance, let me state clearly beforehand the points upon
      which I must touch in this letter. First, I must explain why, having a
      blot upon my life&mdash;being, that is to say, who I am&mdash;I allowed
      Arthur Ripley to marry me. Then I must go on to perform that most painful
      task of all&mdash;tell the story of the death of Bernard Peixada and
      Edward Bolen. Next, I must justify&mdash;what you appear to misunderstand,
      though the grounds of it are really very simple&mdash;the deep resentment
      which I can not help cherishing against your bosom friend, my husband.
      Finally, I must give the reasons that induced me to plead guilty of murder
      an hour ago in court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no. I have put things in their wrong order at the outset. It will not
      be possible for me to explain why I consented to become Arthur&rsquo;s wife,
      until I have given you the true history of Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s death. I must
      command my utmost strength to do this. I must forget nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must force myself to recount every circumstance, hateful as the whole
      subject is. I must search my memory, subdue my feelings, and as
      dispassionately as will be possible, put the entire miserable tale in
      writing. I pray God to help me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am just twenty-six years old&mdash;ten months younger than Arthur. My
      birthday fell while he and I were at New Castle together&mdash;August 4th.
      How little I guessed then that in ten days every thing would be so
      altered! It is strange. I trusted him as I trusted myself. I could not
      conceive the possibility of his deceiving me. He seemed so sincere, so
      simple-minded, so single-hearted, I could as easily have fancied a toad
      issuing from his mouth, as a lie. Yet all the time&mdash;even while we
      were alone together there in New Castle&mdash;he was lying to me. That
      whole fortnight&mdash;that seemed so wonderfully serene and pure and light&mdash;was
      one dark falsehood. Even then, he was having my career investigated here
      in New York, behind my back. And I&mdash;I had offered to tell him every
      thing. Painful as it would have been, I should have told him the whole
      story; but he would not let me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He preferred to hear Benjamin Peixada&rsquo;s&mdash;my enemy&rsquo;s&mdash;version of
      it. Even now, when I have&mdash;plenty&mdash;to remind me of the truth,
      even now, I can scarcely believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must not deviate. As I was saying, I am twenty-six years old. More
      than six years ago, when I was nineteen, nearing twenty, my father said to
      me one day, &rsquo;Mr. Peixada has done us the honor to ask for your hand in
      marriage. We have accepted. So, on the eighth of next August, you will be
      married to him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can not realize, Mr. Hetzel, a tithe of the horror I experienced when
      my father spoke those words to me, until I have gone back further still,
      and told something of my life up to that time. At this moment, as I recall
      the occasion of my father&rsquo;s saying that to me, my heart turns to ice, my
      cheeks burn, my limbs quake, my nature recoils with disgust and loathing.
      It is painful to have to go over it all again, to have to live through it
      all again; yet that is what I have started out to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must know, to begin with, that my father was a watchmaker, and that
      he kept a shop on Second Avenue, between Sixth and Seventh Streets. He was
      a man of great intelligence, of uncommon cultivation, and of a most gentle
      and affectionate disposition; but he was a Jew of the sternest orthodoxy,
      and he held old-fashioned, orthodox notions of the obedience children owe
      to their parents. My father in his youth had intended to become a
      physician; but while he was a student in Berlin, in 1848, the revolution
      broke out; he took part in it; and as a consequence he had to leave
      Germany and come to America before he had won his diploma. Here,
      friendless, penniless, he fell in with a jeweler, named Oppenhym, who
      offered to teach him his trade. Thus he became an apprentice, then a
      journeyman, finally a proprietor. I was born in the house on Second
      Avenue, in the basement of which my father kept his shop. We lived up
      stairs. Our family consisted only of my father and mother, myself, and my
      father&rsquo;s intimate friend, Marcus Nathan. Mr. Nathan was a very learned
      gentleman, who had been a widower and childless for many years, and who
      acted as <i>chazzan</i> in our synagogue. It was to him that my father
      confided my education. It was he who first taught me to read and write and
      to care for books and music. How good and loyal a friend he was to me you
      will learn later on. He died early in 1880.... I did not go to school till
      I was thirteen years old. Then I was sent to the public school in Twelfth
      Street, and thence to the Normal College, where I graduated in 1876. I
      studied the piano at home under the direction of a woman named Emily
      Millard&mdash;an accomplished musician, but unkind and cruel. She used to
      pull my hair and pinch me, when I made mistakes; and afterward, when they
      tried me in the court of General Sessions for Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s murder,
      Miss Millard came and swore that I was bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernard Peixada&mdash;whom the newspapers described as &rsquo;a retired Jewish
      merchant&rsquo;&mdash;was a pawnbroker. His shop was straight across the street
      from ours. I never in my life saw another structure of brick and mortar
      that seemed to frown with such sinister significance, with such ominous
      suggestiveness, upon the street in front of it as did that house of
      Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s. It was a brick house; but the bricks were concealed by
      a coat of dark gray stucco, with blotches here and there that were almost
      black. The shop, of course, was on the ground floor. Its broad windows
      were protected, like those of a jail, by heavy iron bars. Within them was
      exhibited an assortment of such goods and chattels as the pawnbroker had
      contrived to purchase from distress&mdash;musical instruments, household
      ornaments, kitchen utensils, firearms, tarnished suits of uniform, faded
      bits of women&rsquo;s finery&mdash;<i>ex voto</i> offerings at the shrine of
      Mammon. Behind these, all was darkness, and mystery, and gloom. Over the
      door, three golden balls&mdash;golden they had been once, but were no
      longer, thanks to the thief, Time, abetted by wind and weather&mdash;the
      pawnbroker&rsquo;s escutcheon, swayed in the breeze. Higher up still&mdash;big,
      white, ghastly letters on a sable background&mdash;hung a sign, bearing a
      legend like this:
    </p>
    <h3>
      B. PEIXADA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      MONEY LENT ON WATCHES, JEWELRY, PRECIOUS STONES, AND ALL VARIETIES OF
      PERSONAL PROPERTY.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And on the side door, the door that let into the private hallway of the
      house, was screwed a solemn brass plate, with &rsquo;B. Peixada&rsquo; engraved in Old
      English characters upon it. (When Bernard Peixada retired from business,
      he was succeeded by one B. Peinard. On taking possession, Mr. Peinard, for
      economy&rsquo;s sake, caused the last four letters of Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s name on
      the sign to be painted out, and the corresponding letters of his own name
      to be painted in: so that, to this day, the time-stained PEI stands as it
      used to stand years ago, and contrasts oddly with the more recent word
      that follows.) As I have said, the shop windows were defended by an iron
      grating. The other windows&mdash;those of the three upper stories&mdash;were
      hermetically sealed. I, at least, never saw them open. The blinds, once
      green, doubtless, but blackened by age, were permanently closed; and the
      stucco beneath them was fantastically frescoed with the dirt that had been
      washed from them by the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it was partly due to these black blinds, and&rsquo; to the queer shapes
      that the dirt had taken on the wall, that the house had that peculiarly
      sinister aspect that I have spoken of. At all events, you could not glance
      at its façade without shuddering. As early a recollection as any that I
      have, is of how I used to sit at our front windows, and gaze over at
      Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s, and work myself into a very ecstasy of fear by trying
      to imagine the dark and terrible things that were stored behind them. My
      worst nightmares used to be that I was a prisoner in Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s
      house. I never dreamed that some time my most hideous nightmare would be
      surpassed by the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I used to terrify myself by the sight of Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s
      dwelling, much keener was the terror with which Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s person
      inspired me. Picture to yourself a&mdash;creature&mdash;six feet tall,
      gaunt as a skeleton, always dressed in black&mdash;in black broadcloth,
      that glistened like a snake&rsquo;s skin&mdash;with a head&mdash;my pen revolts
      from an attempt to describe it. Yet I must describe it, so that you may
      appreciate a little what I endured when my father said that he had chosen
      Bernard Peixada for my husband. Well, Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s head was thus: a
      hawk&rsquo;s beak for a nose, a hawk&rsquo;s beak inverted for a chin; lips, two thin,
      blue, crooked lines across his face, with yellow fangs behind them, that
      shone horribly when he laughed; eyes, two black, shiny beads, deep-set
      beneath prominent, black, shaggy brows, with the malevolence of a demon
      aflame deep down in them; skull, destitute of honest hair, but kept warm
      by a curling, reddish wig; skin, dry and sallow as old parchment, on which
      dark wrinkles were traced&mdash;a cryptogram, with a meaning, but one
      which I could not perfectly decipher; these were the elements of Bernard
      Peixada&rsquo;s physiognomy&mdash;fit features for a bird of prey, were they
      not? Have you ever seen his brother, Benjamin? the friend of Arthur
      Ripley? Benjamin is corpulent, florid, and on the whole not ill-looking&mdash;morally
      and physically vastly superior to his elder brother. But fancy Benjamin
      pumped dry of blood, shrunken to the dimensions of a mummy, then bewigged,
      then caricatured by an enemy, and you will form a tolerably vivid
      conception of how Bernard Peixada looked. But his looks were not all. His
      voice, I think, was worse. It was a thin, piercing voice that, when I
      heard it, used to set my heart palpitating with a hundred horrible
      emotions. It was a dry, metallic voice that grated like a file. It was a
      sharp, jerky voice that seemed to chop the air, each word sounding like a
      blow from an ax. It was a voice which could not be forced to say a kind
      and human thing. Cruelty and harshness were natural to it. I can hear it
      ringing in my ears, as I am writing now; and it makes my heart sink and my
      hand tremble, as it used to do when I indeed heard it, issuing from his
      foul, cruel mouth. Will you be surprised&mdash;will you think I am
      exaggerating&mdash;when I say that Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s hideousness did not
      end with his voice? I should do his portrait an injustice if I were to
      omit mention of his hands&mdash;his claws, rather, for claws they were
      shaped like; and, instead of fingers, they were furnished with long,
      brown, bony talons, terminated by black, untrimmed nails. I do not believe
      I ever saw Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s hands in repose. They were in perpetual,
      nervous motion&mdash;the talons clutching at the air, if at nothing more
      substantial&mdash;even when he slept. The most painful dreams that I have
      had, since God delivered me of him, have been those in which I have seen
      his hands, working, working, the fingers writhing like serpents, as they
      were wont to do in life. Oh, such a monstrosity! Oh, such a wicked
      travesty of man! This, Mr. Hetzel, was the person to f-whom my father
      proposed to marry me. There was no one to plead for me, no one to
      interfere in my behalf. And I was a young girl, nineteen years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could my father do it? How could he bring himself to do this thing?
      It is a long story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, Bernard Peixada was accounted a most estimable member
      of society. He was rich; he was pious; he was eminently respectable. His
      ill-looks were ignored. Was he to blame for them? people asked. Did he not
      close his shop regularly on every holiday? Who was more precise than he in
      observing the feasts and fasts of the Hebrew calendar? or in attending
      services at the Synagogue? Was smoke ever to be seen issuing from his
      chimneys on the Sabbath? Old as he was, did he not abstain from food on
      the fast of Gedalia, and on that of Tebeth, and on that of Tamuz, as well
      as on the Ninth of Ab and on Yom Kippur? Had he not, year after year, been
      elected and re-elected <i>Parnass</i> of the congregation? All honor to
      him, then, for a wise man and an upright man in the way of the law! It was
      thus that public opinion in our small world treated Bernard Peixada. On
      the theory that handsome is that handsome does, he got the credit of being
      quite a paragon of beauty. To be sure, he lacked social qualities&mdash;he
      was scarcely a hail-fellow-well-met. He cared little for wine and tobacco&mdash;he
      abhorred dominoes&mdash;he could not be induced to sit down to a game of
      <i>penacle</i>; but all the better! The absence of these frivolous
      interests proved him to be a man of responsible weight and gravity. It was
      a pity he had never married. Perhaps it was not yet too late. Lucky the
      girl upon whom his eye should turn with favor. If he had not youth and
      bodily grace to offer her, he had, at least, wealth, wisdom, and
      respectability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernard Peixada had been the black beast of my childhood. When I would go
      with my mother to the Synagogue, and sit with her in the women&rsquo;s gallery,
      I could not keep my eyes off Bernard.. Peixada, who occupied the
      president&rsquo;s chair downstairs. The sight of him had an uncanny fascination
      for me. As I grew older, it was still the same. Bernard Peixada
      personified to me all that was evil in human nature. He was the Ahriman,
      the Antichrist, of my theology. He made my flesh creep&mdash;gave me a
      sensation similar to that which a snake gives one&mdash;only incomparably
      more intense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, one evening in the early spring of 1878, I was seated in our little
      parlor over the shop, striving to entertain a very dull young man&mdash;a
      Mr. Rimo, Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s nephew&mdash;when the door opened, and who
      should come gliding in but Bernard Peixada himself? I had never before
      seen him at such close quarters, unless my father or mother or Mr. Nathan
      was present too; and then I had derived a sense of security from realizing
      that I had a friend near by. But now, here he was in the very room with
      me, and I all alone, except for this nephew of his, Mr. Rimo. I had to
      catch for my breath, and my heart grew faint within me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernard Peixada simply said good evening and sat down. I do not remember
      that he spoke another word until he rose to go away. But for two hours he
      sat there opposite me, and not for one instant did he take his eyes from
      off my face. He sat still, like a toad, and leered at me. His blue lips
      were curled into a grin, which, no doubt, was intended to be reassuring,
      but which, in fact, sent cold shivers chasing down my back. He stared at
      me as he might have stared at some inanimate object that had been offered
      to him in pawn. Then at last, when he must have learned every line and
      angle of my face by rote, he got up and went away, leading Mr. Rimo after
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lay awake all that night, wondering what Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s visit meant,
      hoping that it meant nothing, fearing&mdash;but it would take too long for
      me to tell you all I feared. Suffice it that the next afternoon&mdash;I
      was seated in my bed-room, trying to divert my imagination with a tale of
      Hawthorne&rsquo;s&mdash;the next afternoon my father called me into his office
      behind the shop, and there in the presence of my mother he corroborated
      the worst fears that had beset me during the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Judith,&rsquo; he said, &rsquo;our neighbor, Mr. Peixada, has done us the honor of
      proposing for your hand. Of course we have accepted. He designates the
      eighth of August for the wedding-day. That will give you plenty of time to
      get ready in; and on Sundays you will stay at home to receive
      congratulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It took a little while, Mr. Hetzel, for the full meaning of my father&rsquo;s
      speech to penetrate my mind. At first I did not comprehend&mdash;I was
      stupefied, bewildered. My senses were benumbed. Mechanically, I watched my
      father&rsquo;s canary-bird hop from perch to perch in his cage, and listened to
      the shrill whistle that he uttered from time to time. I was conscious of a
      dizziness in my head, of a sickness and a chill over all my body. But
      then, suddenly, the horror shot through me&mdash;pierced my consciousness
      like a knife. Suddenly my senses became wonderfully clear. I saw the black
      misery that they had prepared for me, in a quick, vivid tableau before my
      eyes. I trembled from head to foot. I tried to speak, to cry out, to
      protest. If I could only have let the pain break forth in an inarticulate
      moan, it would have been some relief. But my tongue clove to the roof of
      my mouth. I could not utter a sound. &rsquo;Well, Judith,&rsquo; said my father, &rsquo;why
      don&rsquo;t you speak?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His words helped me to find my voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Speak!&rsquo; I cried. &rsquo;What is there to say? Marry Bernard Peixada? Marry
      that monster? I will never marry him. I would a thousand times rather
      die.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother and father looked at me and at each other in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Judith,&rsquo; said my father, sternly, &rsquo;that is not the language that a
      daughter should use toward her parents. That is not the way a young lady
      should feel, either. Of course you will marry Mr. Peixada. Don&rsquo;t make a
      scene about it. It has all been arranged between us; and your betrothed is
      coming to claim you in half an hour.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; I answered, very calmly, &rsquo;I am sorry to rebel against your
      authority, but I tell you now, once for all, I will not marry Bernard
      Peixada.&rsquo; &rsquo;Judith,&rsquo; rejoined my father, imitating my manner, &rsquo;I am sorry
      to contradict you, but I tell you now, once for all, you will.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Never,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;On the eighth of August,&rsquo; said my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Time will show,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Time will show,&rsquo; said he, &rsquo;in less than fifteen minutes. Judith,
      listen.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an old story that my father now proceeded to tell me&mdash;old,
      and yet as new as it is terrible to the girl who has to listen to it. It
      does not break the heart in two, like the old, old story of Heine&rsquo;s song:
      it inflames the heart with a dull, sullen anguish that is the worst pain a
      woman can be called upon to endure. My father told me how for two years
      past his pecuniary affairs had been going to the dogs; how he had been
      getting poor and poorer; how he had become Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s debtor for
      sums of money that he could never hope to pay; how Bernard Peixada owned
      not only the wares in our shop, but the very chairs we sat on, the very
      beds we slept in, the very plates off which we ate; how, indeed, it was
      Bernard Peixada who paid for the daily bread that kept our bodies and
      souls together. My father explained all this to me, concluding thus: &rsquo;I
      was in despair, Judith. I thought I should go crazy. I saw nothing but
      disgrace and the poor-house before your mother and you and me. I could not
      sleep at night. I could not work during the day. I could do nothing but
      think, think, think of the desperate pass to which my affairs had come. It
      was an agony, Judith. It would soon have killed me, or driven me mad.
      Then, all at once, the darkness of my&mdash;sky is lightened by this good
      man, whom I have already to thank for so much. He calls upon me. He says
      he will show me a way out of my difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask what it is. He answers, why not unite our families, accept him as
      my son-in-law? and adds that between son-in-law and father-in-law there
      can be no question of indebtedness. In other words, he told me that he
      loved you, Judith; that he wished to marry you; and that, once married to
      you, he would consider my debts to him discharged. Try, Judith, to realize
      his generosity. I&mdash;I owe him thousands. But for him we should have
      starved. But for him, we should starve to-morrow. Ordinary gratitude alone
      would have been enough to compel me to say yes to his proposition. But by
      saying yes, did I not also accomplish our own salvation? Now that you have
      heard the whole story, Judith, now, like a good girl, promise to make no
      opposition.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So that,&rsquo; I retorted, indignantly, &rsquo;I am to be your ransom&mdash;I am to
      be sacrificed as a hostage. The pawnbroker consents to receive me as an
      equivalent for the money you owe him. A woman to be literally bought and
      sold. Oh, father, no, no! There must be some other way. Let me go to work.
      Have I not already earned money by giving lessons? I will teach from
      morning to night each day; and every penny that I gain, I will give to you
      to pay Bernard Peixada with. I will be so industrious! I would rather
      slave the flesh from my bones&mdash;any thing, rather than marry him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The most you could earn,&rsquo; my father answered, &rsquo;would be no more than a
      drop in the bucket, Judith.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; I went on, &rsquo;there is Mr. Nathan. He has money. Borrow from
      him. He will not refuse. I know that he would gladly give much money to
      save me from a marriage with Bernard Peixada. I will ask him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judith, you must not speak of this to Mr. Nathan,&rsquo; cried my father,
      hastily. &rsquo;He must not know but that your marriage to Mr. Peixada is an act
      of your own choice. I&mdash;to tell you the truth&mdash;I have already
      borrowed from Mr. Nathan as much as I dare to ask for.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To cut a long story short, Mr. Hetzel, my father drew for me such a dark
      picture of his misfortunes, he argued so plausibly that all depended upon
      my marrying Bernard Peixada, he pleaded so piteously, that in the end I
      said, &rsquo;Well, father, I will do as you wish.&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think it is necessary to dwell upon what followed: how my father
      and mother embraced me, and wept over me, and thanked me, and gave me
      their benediction; how Bernard Peixada came from his lair across the
      street, and kissed my hand, and leered at me, and called me &rsquo;Judith&rsquo; in
      that voice of his; how then, for weeks afterward, my life was one
      protracted, hopeless horror; how the sun rose morning after morning, and
      brought neither warmth nor light, but only a reminder that the eighth of
      August was one day nearer still; how I could speak of it to no one, but
      had to bear it all alone in silence; how at night my sleep was constantly
      beset by nightmares, in which I got a bitter foretaste of the future; how
      evening after evening I had to spend in the parlor with Bernard Peixada,
      listening to his voice, watching his fingers writhe, feeling the deadly
      light of his eyes upon me, breathing the air that his presence tainted;
      how every Sunday I had to receive people&rsquo;s <i>congratulations!</i> the
      good wishes of all our family friends&mdash;I need not dwell upon these
      things. My life was a long heart-ache. I had but one relief&mdash;hoping
      that I might die. I did not think of putting an end to myself; but I did
      pray that God, in his mercy, would let me die before the eighth of August
      came. Indeed, my health was very much broken. Our family doctor visited me
      twice a week. He told my father that marriage would be bad for me. But my
      father&rsquo;s hands were tied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people here tell me that there is a man confined in this prison under
      sentence to be hanged. The day fixed for his execution is the first Friday
      of next month. Well, I think that that man, now, as he looks forward to
      the first Friday of September, may feel a little as I felt then, when I
      would look forward to the eighth of August&mdash;only he has the
      mitigation of knowing that afterward he will be dead, whereas I knew that
      I should have to live and suffer worse things still. As I saw that day
      steadily creeping nearer and nearer to me, the horror that bound my heart
      intensified. It was like the old Roman spectacle. I had been flung <i>ad
      bestias</i>. I stood still, defenseless, beyond the reach of rescue,
      hopeless of escape, and watched the wild beast draw closer and closer to
      me, and all the while endured the agony of picturing to myself the final
      moment, when he would spring upon me and suck my blood: only, again there
      was this difference&mdash;the martyr in the arena knew that after that
      final moment, all would be over; but I knew that the worst would then just
      be begun. Yet, at last&mdash;toward the end&mdash;I actually fell to
      wishing that the final moment would arrive. The torture, long drawn out,
      of anticipation was so unbearable that I actually wished the wild beast
      would fall upon me, in order that I might enjoy the relief of change.
      Nothing, I felt, could be more painful than this waiting, dreading,
      imagining. The eighth of August could bring no terror that I had not
      already confronted in imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this one wish of mine was granted. The eighth of August came. I was
      married to Bernard Peixada. I stood up in our parlor, decked out in bridal
      costume, holding Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s hand in mine, and took the vows of
      matrimony in the presence of a hundred witnesses. The canopy was raised
      over our heads; the wine was drunken and spilled; the glass was broken.
      The <i>chazzan</i> sang his song; the rabbi said his say; and I, who had
      gone through the performance in a sort of stupor&mdash;dull, half
      conscious, bewildered&mdash;I was suddenly brought to my senses by a
      clamor of cheerful voices, as the wedding-guests trooped up around us, to
      felicitate the bridegroom and to kiss the bride. I realized&mdash;no, I
      did not yet realize&mdash;but I understood that I was Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s
      wife&mdash;<i>his wife</i>, for good and all, for better or for worse! I
      don&rsquo;t remember that I suffered any new pain. The intense suffering of the
      last few months had worn out my capacities for suffering. My brain was
      dazed, my heart deadened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people came and came, and talked and talked&mdash;I remember it as I
      remember the delirium I had when I was sick once with fever. And after the
      last person had come and talked and gone away, Bernard Peixada offered me
      his arm, and said, &rsquo;We must take our places at the wedding feast.&rsquo; Then he
      led me up-stairs, where long tables were laid out for supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A strange sense of unreality possessed me. In a vague, dreamy, far-off
      way, I saw the guests stand up around the tables; saw the men cover their
      heads with hats or handkerchiefs; heard the voice of Mr. Nathan raised in
      prayer; heard the company join lustily in his &rsquo;<i>Baruch Adonai,&rsquo;.</i> and
      reverently in his final &rsquo;<i>Amen</i>&rsquo; saw the head-gear doffed, the people
      sink into their seats; heard the clatter of knives and forks mingle with
      the tinkling of glasses, the bubble of pouring wine, the uproar of talk
      and laughter; was conscious of glaring lights, of moving forms, of the
      savor of food, mixed with the perfume of flowers and the odor of cologne
      on the women&rsquo;s handkerchiefs: felt hot, dazzled, suffocated, confused&mdash;an
      oppression upon my breast, a ringing in my ears, a swimming in my head:
      the world was whirling around and around&mdash;I alone, in the center of
      things, was motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So on for I knew not how long. In the end I became aware that speeches
      were being made. The wedding feast, that meant, was nearly over. I did not
      listen to the speeches. But they reminded me of something that I had
      forgotten. Now, indeed, my heart stood still. They reminded me that the
      moment was not far off when Bernard Peixada, when <i>my husband</i>, would
      lead me away with him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The speeches were wound up. Mr. Nathan began his last grace. My mother
      signaled me to be ready to come to her as soon as Mr. Nathan should get
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Judith,&rsquo; she said, when I had reached her side, &rsquo;we had better go
      up-stairs now, and change your dress.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We went up-stairs. When we came down again, we found Bernard Peixada
      waiting in the hall. Through the open door of the parlor, I could hear
      music, and see young men and women dancing. Oh, how I envied them! My
      mother and father kissed me. Bernard Peixada grasped my arm. We left my
      father&rsquo;s house. We crossed the street. Bernard Peixada kept hold of my
      arm, as if afraid that I might make a dash for liberty&mdash;as, indeed,
      my impulse urged me to do. With his unoccupied hand, Bernard Peixada drew
      a key from his pocket, and opened the side door of his own dark abode&mdash;the
      door that bore the brass plate with the Old English letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, &rsquo;come in.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a shudder, I crossed the threshold of that mysterious, sinister
      house&mdash;of that house which had been the terror of my childhood, and
      was to be&mdash;what? In the midst of my fear and my bewilderment, I could
      not suppress a certain eagerness to confront my fate and know the worst at
      once&mdash;a certain curiosity to learn the full ghastliness of my doom.
      In less time than I had bargained for, I had my wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus far Hetzel had read consecutively. At this point he was interrupted
      by the entrance of Mrs. Hart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you busy?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Because, if you&rsquo;re not, I think you had better
      go up-stairs and sit with Arthur. The nurse wants to eat her breakfast and
      lie down for a while. And I, you know, am expected by Ruth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to be sure,&rdquo; Hetzel replied, with a somewhat abstracted manner. &ldquo;Oh,
      yes&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do as you wish at once. But it is a pity that you should
      have to go down-town alone&mdash;especially in this weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind that. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel gained the sick-room. The nurse said, &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have much to do,
      except sit down and keep quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur lay motionless, for all the world as if asleep, save that his eyes
      were open. The room was darkened. Hetzel sat down near to the window, and
      returning to Ruth&rsquo;s letter, read on by the light that stole in through the
      chinks in the blinds. The wind and rain played a dreary accompaniment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To detain you, Mr. Hetzel, with an account of my married life would be
      superfluous. It was as bad as I had expected it to be, and worse. It bore
      that relation to my anticipations which pain realized must always bear to
      pain conjectured. The imagination, in anticipating pleasure, generally
      goes beyond the reality and paints a too highly colored picture. But in
      anticipating suffering, it does not go half far enough. It is not powerful
      enough to foretell suffering in its complete intensity.

      &ldquo;Sweet is never so sweet as we imagine it will be; bitter is always at
      least a shade bitterer than we are prepared for. Imagination slurs over
      the little things&mdash;and the little things, trifles in themselves, are
      the things that add to the poignancy of suffering. Bernard Peixada had a
      copy of Dante&rsquo;s <i>Inferno</i>, illustrated by Doré, on his sitting-room
      table. You may guess what my life was like, when I tell you that I used to
      turn the pages of that book, and literally envy the poor wretches
      portrayed there their fire and brimstone. The utmost refinement of torture
      that Dante and Doré between them could conceive and describe, seemed like
      child&rsquo;s play when I contrasted it to what I had to put up with everyday.
      Bernard Peixada was cruel and coarse and false. It did not take him a
      great while to fathom the disgust that he inspired me with; and then he
      undertook to avenge his wounded self-love. He contrived mortifications and
      humiliations for me that I can not bring myself to name, that you would
      have difficulty in crediting. Besides, this period of my life is not
      essential to what I have set myself to make plain to you. It was simply a
      period of mental and moral wretchedness, and of bodily decline. My health,
      which, I think I have said, had been failing before the eighth of August,
      now proceeded steadily from bad to worse. It was aggravated by the daily
      trials I had to endure. Of course I strove to bear up as bravely as I
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not wish Bernard Peixada to have the satisfaction of seeing how
      unhappy he had succeeded in making me. I did not wish my poor father and
      mother to witness the misery I had taken upon myself in obedience to their
      behests. I said, &rsquo;That which is done is done, and can not be undone,
      therefore let it not appear what the ordeal costs you.&rsquo; And in the main I
      think I was successful. Only occasionally, when I was alone, I would give
      myself the luxury of crying. I had never realized what a relief crying
      could be till now. But now well, when I would be seized by a paroxysm of
      grief that I could not control, when amid tears and sobs I would no doubt
      look most pitiable&mdash;it was then that I came nearest to being happy. I
      remember, on one of these occasions&mdash;Bernard Peixada had gone out
      somewhere&mdash;I was surprised by a sanctimonious old woman, a friend of
      his, if friendship can subsist between such people, a certain Mrs.
      Washington Shapiro. &rsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said she, &rsquo;what are you crying for?&rsquo; I was
      in a desperate mood. I did not care what I said; nay, more than this, I
      enjoyed a certain forlorn pleasure in speaking my true mind &rsquo;for once,
      especially to this <i>friend</i> of Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s. &rsquo;Oh,&rsquo; I answered,
      &rsquo;I am crying because I wish Bernard Peixada was dead and buried.&rsquo; I had to
      smile through my tears at the horror-stricken countenance Mrs. Shapiro now
      put on. &rsquo;What! You wish Bernard Peixada was dead?&rsquo; she exclaimed. &rsquo;Shame
      upon you! How can you say such a thing!&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;He is a monster&mdash;he
      makes me unhappy,&rsquo; I responded. &rsquo;In that case,&rsquo; said Mrs. Shapiro, &rsquo;you
      ought to wish that you yourself were dead, not he. It is you who are
      monstrous, for thinking and saying such wicked things of that good man.&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;Oh,&rsquo;
      I rejoined, &rsquo;I am young. I have much to live for. He is an old, bad man.
      If he should die, it would be better for every body.&rsquo;&mdash;This was, as
      nearly as I can remember, a month or two before the night of July 30th. As
      I have told you, it was a piece of self-indulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I enjoyed speaking my true sentiments; I enjoyed horrifying Mrs. Shapiro.
      But I was duly punished. She took pains to repeat what I had said to
      Bernard Peixada. He did not fail to administer an adequate punishment.
      Afterward, when I was tried for murder, Mrs. Shapiro turned up, and
      retailed our conversation to the jury, for the purpose of establishing my
      evil disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in the autumn after my marriage that my father was stricken with
      paralysis, and died. It was better for him. If he had lived, he could not
      have: remained ignorant of his daughter&rsquo;s misery; and then he would have
      had to suffer the pangs of futile self reproach. Of course he left nothing
      for my mother. The creditors took possession of every thing. Bernard
      Peixada had been false to his bargain. Instead of canceling my father&rsquo;s
      indebtedness to him, as he had promised, he had simply j sold his claims.
      Immediately after my father&rsquo;s death, the creditors swooped down upon his
      house and shop, and sold the last stick of: furniture over my mother&rsquo;s
      head. Mr. Nathan generously bought in the things that were most precious
      as keep-sakes and family relics, and returned them to my mother, after the
      vultures had flown away. Oddly enough, they did not appear to blame
      Bernard Preixada&mdash;did not hold him accountable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They continued to regard him as a paragon of manly virtue. Perhaps he
      contrived some untruthful explanation, by which they were deceived I had
      naturally hoped that now my mother would come to live with us. It would
      have been a great comfort to me, if she had done so. But Bernard Peixada
      wished otherwise. He cunningly persuaded her that she and I had best dwell
      apart. So he supplied her with enough money to pay her expenses and sent
      her to board in the family of a friend of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, somehow, that fall and winter dragged away. It is something
      terrible for me to look back at&mdash;that blackest, bleakest winter of my
      life. I not understand how I managed to live through it without going mad.
      I was a prisoner in Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s house. My mother and Mr. Nathan came
      to see me quite frequently; but Bernard was present during their visits
      and therefore I got but little solace from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only persons except my mother and Mr. Nathan whom Bernard Peixada
      permitted me to receive, were his own friends. And they were one and all
      hateful to me. To my friends he denied admittance, I was physically very
      weak. My ill health made it impossible for me to forget myself in my
      books. The effort of reading was too exhausting. I could not sit for more
      than a quarter of an hour at the piano? either, without all but fainting
      away. (Mr. Nathan had given me a piano for a wedding-present.) At the time
      I am referring to&mdash;when I was unable to play upon it&mdash;Bernard
      Peixada allowed me the free use of it. But afterward&mdash;when I had
      become stronger, and began to practice regularly&mdash;one day I found it
      locked. Bernard Peixada stood near by, and watched me try to open it. I
      looked at him, when I saw that I could not open it, and he looked at me.
      Oh, the contortion of his features, the twisting of his thin blue lips,
      the glitter of his venomous little eyes, the loathsome gurgle in his
      throat, as he <i>laughed!</i> He laughed at my dismay. Laughter? At least,
      I know no other word by which to name the hideous spasm that convulsed his
      voice. The result was, I passed my days moping. He objected to my leaving
      the house, except in his company. I had therefore to remain within doors.
      I used to sit at the window, and watch the life below in the street, and
      look across at our house&mdash;now occupied by strangers&mdash;and live
      over the past&mdash;my childhood, my girlhood&mdash;always stopping at the
      day and the hour when my father had called me from the reading of that
      story of Hawthorne&rsquo;s, to announce my doom to me. But I am wasting your
      time. All this is aside from the point. I did survive that winter. And
      when the spring came, I began to get better in health, and to become
      consequently more hopeful in spirit. I said, Why, you are not yet
      twenty-one years old. He is sixty&mdash;and feeble at that. Only try hard
      to hold out a little longer&mdash;a few years at the most&mdash;and he
      must, in the mere course of nature, die. Then you will not yet be an old
      woman. Life will still be worth something to you. You will have your
      music, and you will be rid of him.&rsquo; Wicked? Unwomanly? Perhaps so; but I
      think it was the way every girl in my position would have felt. However,
      the consolation that came from thoughts like this, was short-lived. The
      next moment it would occur to me, &rsquo;He may quite possibly live to be
      ninety!&rsquo; And my heart would sink at the prospect of thirty years&mdash;<i>thirty
      years</i>&mdash;more of life as his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In March, 1879, Bernard Peixada spoke to me as follows: &rsquo;Judith, you are
      not going to be a pawnbroker&rsquo;s wife much longer. I have, made arrangements
      to sell my business. I have leased a house up-town. We shall move on the
      1st of May. After that we shall be a gentleman and lady of leisure.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely enough, on the 1st of May we moved. The house he had leased was a
      frame house, standing all alone in the middle of the block, between
      Eighty-fifth and Eighty-sixth Streets and Ninth and Tenth Avenues. It was
      a large, substantial, comfortable house, dating from Knickerbocker times.
      He had caused it to be furnished in a style which he meant to be
      luxurious, but which was, in truth, the extreme of ugliness. The grounds
      around it were laid out in a garden. We went to live there punctually on
      the 1st of May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernard Peixada now began to spend money with a lavish hand. He bought
      fine clothes and jewels, in which he required me to array myself. He even
      went to the length of purchasing a carriage and a pair of horses. Then he
      would make me go driving at his side through Central Park. He kept a
      coachman. The coachman was Edward Bolen. (Meanwhile, I must not forget to
      tell you, Bernard Peixada had quarreled and broken with my mother and Mr.
      Nathan. Now he allowed neither of them to enter his house.) I was in
      absolute ignorance concerning them. Once I ventured to ask him for news of
      them. He scowled. He said, &rsquo;You must never mention them in my presence.&rsquo;
      And he accompanied this injunction with such a look that I was careful to
      observe it scrupulously thereafter. I received no letters from them. You
      may imagine what an addition all this was to my burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is of Edward Bolen that I must tell you at present. He was a
      repulsive looking Irishman. It is needless that I should describe him.
      Suffice it that at first I was unsuspicious enough to accept him for what
      he ostensibly was&mdash;Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s coachman&mdash;but that ere a
      great while I discovered, that he was something else, besides. I
      discovered that he and Bernard Peixada had secrets together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At night, after the household had gone to bed, he and Bernard Peixada
      would meet in the parlor, and hold long conversations in low tones. What
      they talked about, I did not know. But this I did know&mdash;it was not
      about the horses. I concluded that they were mutually interested in some
      bad business&mdash;that they were hatching some villainous plots together&mdash;but,
      I confess, I did not much care what the business was, or what the plots
      were. Only, the fact that they were upon this footing of confidence with
      each other, struck me, and abode in my memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One afternoon, about a fortnight before the thirtieth of July, Bernard
      Peixada had taken me to drive in Central Park. As I was getting out of the
      carriage, upon our return, I tripped somehow, and fell, and sprained my
      ankle. This sent me to my room. Dr. Gunther, Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s physician,
      attended me. He said I should not be able to walk, probably for a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than a week later, toward sunset, I was lying there on my bed.
      Bernard Peixada had been absent from the house all day. Now I heard his
      footfall below in the corridor&mdash;then on the stairs&mdash;then in the
      hall outside my door. I took for granted that he was coming to speak with
      me. I recoiled from the idea of speaking with him just then. So I closed
      my eyes, and pretended to be asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came in. He approached my bedside, kept my eyes shut tight. &rsquo;Judith,&rsquo;
      he said, did not answer&mdash;feigned not to hear. &rsquo;Judith,&rsquo; repeated.
      Again I did not answer. He placed his hand upon my forehead. I tried not
      to shudder. I guess she&rsquo;s sound asleep,&rsquo; he said; &rsquo;that&rsquo;s good.&rsquo; He moved
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His words, &rsquo;that&rsquo;s good,&rsquo; Mr. Hetzel, frightened me. Why was it &rsquo;good&rsquo;
      that I should be asleep? Did he intend to do me a mischief while I slept?
      I opened my eyes the least bit. I saw him standing sidewise to me, a yard
      or so away. He drew a number of papers from the inside pocket of his coat.
      He ran them over. He laid one of them aside, and replaced the others in
      his pocket. Then he went to the safe&mdash;he kept a small safe in our
      bed-chamber&mdash;and opening the door&mdash;the door remained unlocked
      all day; his habit being to lock it at night and unlock it in the morning&mdash;he
      thrust the paper I have mentioned into one of the pigeonholes, pushed the
      door to, and left the room. I had seen him do all this through half closed
      eyes. Doubtless this was why it was &rsquo;good&rsquo; for me to be asleep&mdash;so
      that he could do what he had done, unobserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I was entirely reprehensible&mdash;that my conduct admitted of
      no excuse. However that may be, the fact is that an impulse prompted me to
      get up from my bed, and to possess myself of the paper that he had put
      into the safe. I did not stop to question or to combat that impulse. No
      sooner thought, than I jumped up&mdash;and cried out loud! I had forgotten
      my sprained ankle! For an instant I stood still, faint with pain,
      terrified lest he might have heard my scream&mdash;lest he might return,
      find me on my feet, divine my intention, and punish me as he knew so well
      how to do. But while I stood there, undetermined whether to turn back or
      to pursue my original idea, the terror passed away. I limped across the
      floor, pulled the safe door open, put in my hand, grasped the paper, drew
      it out, swung the door back, regained my bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There I had to lie still for a little, and recover my breath. I had
      miscalculated my strength. The effort had exhausted me. My ankle was
      aching cruelly&mdash;the pains shot far up into my body. But by and by I
      felt better. I unfolded the paper, smoothed it out, glanced at it.. This
      was all I had earned by my exertions:&mdash;&rsquo;R. 174.&mdash;L. 36s.&mdash;R.
      222.&mdash;L. 30.&rsquo; This was all that was written upon the paper. And what
      this meant, how could I tell? I made up my mind, after much puzzling, that
      it must be a secret writing&mdash;a cipher of one sort or another. I was
      not sorry that I had purloined it, though I was disappointed at its
      contents. I felt sure that Bernard Peixada could scarcely mean to employ
      it for good ends. So it was just as well that I should have taken it from
      him. I was on the point of destroying it, when I decided not to. &rsquo;No, I
      had best not destroy it,&rsquo; I thought. &rsquo;It possibly may be of value. I will
      hide it where he can not find it.&rsquo; I hid it beneath the mattress on which
      I lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How absurd and unreasonable my whole proceeding had been, had it not?
      Much ado about nothing! With no adequate motive, and at the cost of much
      suffering to myself, I had committed an unnecessary theft; and the fruit
      of it was that incomprehensible row of figures. The whim of a sick woman.
      And yet, though I recognized this aspect of the case with perfect
      clearness, I could not find it in me to repent what I had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That night Bernard Peixada and Edward Bolen talked together till past
      midnight, in the parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you believe in premonitions, in presentiments, Mr.
      Hetzel. I scarcely know whether I do, myself. But from the moment I woke
      up, on the morning of July 30th, I was possessed by a strange, vague, yet
      irresistible foreboding that something was going to happen&mdash;something
      extraordinary, something of importance. At first this was simply a not
      altogether unpleasant feeling of expectancy. As the day wore on, however,
      it intensified. It became a fear, then a dread, then a breathless terror.
      I could ascribe it to no rational cause. I struggled with it&mdash;endeavored
      to shake it off. No use. It clutched at my heart&mdash;tightly&mdash;more
      tightly. I sought to reassure myself, by having recourse to a little
      materialism. I said, &rsquo;It is because you are not as well as usual to-day.
      It is the reaction of body upon mind.&rsquo; Despite the utmost I could say, the
      feeling grew and grew upon me, till it was well-nigh insupportable. Yet I
      could not force it to take a definite shape. Was it that something had
      happened, or was going to happen, to my mother? to Mr. Nathan? to me? I
      could not tell&mdash;all I knew was that my heart ached, that at every
      slightest sound it would start into my mouth&mdash;then palpitate so madly
      that I could scarcely catch my breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not seen Bernard Peixada at all that day. Whether he was in the
      house, or absent from it, I had not inquired. But just before dinner-time&mdash;at
      about six o&rsquo;clock&mdash;he entered my room. My heart stood still. Now, I
      felt, what I had been dreading since early morning, was on the point of
      accomplishment. I tried to nerve myself for the worst. Probably he would
      announce some bad news about <i>my</i> mother.&mdash;But I was mistaken.
      He said only this: &rsquo;After dinner, Judith, you will call the servants to
      your room, and give them leave of absence for the night. They need not
      return till to-morrow morning. Do you understand?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood and yet I did not understand. I understood the bald fact&mdash;that
      the servants were to have leave of absence for the night&mdash;but the
      significance of the fact I did not understand. I knew very well that
      Bernard Peixada had a motive for granting them this indulgence, that it
      was not due to a pure and simple impulse of good-nature on his part: but
      what the motive was, I could not divine. I confess, the fear that had been
      upon me was augmented. So long as our two honest, kindly Irish girls were
      in the house, I enjoyed a certain sense of security. How defenseless
      should I be, with them away! A thousand wild alarms beset my imagination.
      Perhaps the presentiment that had oppressed me all day, meant that Bernard
      Peixada was meditating doing me a bodily injury. Perhaps this was why he
      wished the servants to be absent. Unreasonable? As you please.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Is this privilege,&rsquo; I asked, &rsquo;to be extended to the coachman, also?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Who told you to concern yourself about the coachman? I will look after
      him,&rsquo; was Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I concluded that the case stood thus:&mdash;I was to be left alone with
      Bernard Peixada and Edward Bolen. The pair of them had something to j
      accomplish in respect to me&mdash;which&mdash;well, in the fullness of
      time I should learn the nature of their j designs. I remembered the paper
      that I had stolen. Had Bernard Peixada discovered that it was missing, and
      concealed the discovery from me? Was he now bent upon recovering the
      paper? and upon chastising me, as, from his point of view, I deserved to
      be chastised? Again, in the fullness of time I should learn. I strove to
      possess my soul in patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernard Peixada left me. One of our servants brought me my dinner. I told
      her that she might go out for the night, and asked her to send the other
      girl to my room. To this latter, also, I delivered the message that
      Bernard Peixada had charged me with.&mdash;When they tried me for murder,
      Mr. Hetzel, they produced both of these girls as witnesses against me,
      hoping to show, by their testimony, that I had prearranged to be alone in
      the house with Bernard Peixada and Edward Bolen, so that I could take
      their lives at my ease, with no one by to interfere, or to survive and
      tell the story!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The long July twilight faded out of the sky. Night fell. I was alone in
      the house&mdash;isolated from the street&mdash;beyond hope of rescue&mdash;at
      the mercy of Bernard Peixada and his coachman, Edward Bolen. I lay still
      in bed, waiting for their onslaught.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I waited and waited; and they made no onslaught. I heard the clock
      strike eight, then nine, then ten, then eleven. No sign from the enemy.
      Gradually the notion grew upon me&mdash;I could not avoid it&mdash;that I
      had been absurdly deluding myself&mdash;that my alarms had been
      groundless. Gradually I became persuaded that my premonition had been the
      nonsensical fancy of a sick woman. Gradually my anxiety subsided, and I
      fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long I slept I do not know. Suddenly I awoke. In fewer seconds than
      are required for writing it, I leaped from profound slumber to wide
      wakefulness. My heart was beating violently; my breath was coming in
      quick, short gasps; my forehead was wet with perspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sat up in bed, and looked around. My night-lamp was burning on the
      table. There was no second person in my room. The hands of the clock
      marked twenty-five minutes before one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I listened. Stillness so deep that I could hear my heart beat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could it be, then, that had awakened me so abruptly?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I continued to listen. Hark! Did I not hear&mdash;yes, certainly, I heard&mdash;the
      sound of voices&mdash;of men&rsquo;s voices&mdash;in the room below. Bernard
      Peix-ada and Edward Bolen were holding one of their midnight sessions.
      That was all. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was all: an every-night occurrence. And yet, for what reason I can
      not tell, on this particular night that familiar occurrence portended much
      to me. Ordinarily, I should have lain abed, and left them to talk till
      their tongues were tired. On this particular night&mdash;why, I did not
      stop to ask myself&mdash;swayed by an impulse which I did not stop to
      analyze&mdash;I got straightway out of bed, crept to the open window, and
      standing there in the chilling atmosphere, played the eavesdropper to the
      best of my powers. Was it woman&rsquo;s curiosity? In that event, woman&rsquo;s
      curiosity serves a good end now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The room in which they were established, was, as I have said, directly
      beneath my own. Their window was directly beneath my window. Their window,
      like mine, was open. I heard each syllable that they spoke as distinctly
      as I could have heard, if they had been only a yard away. Each syllable
      stenographed itself upon my memory. I believe that I can repeat their
      conversation word for word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernard Peixada was saying this: &rsquo;You know the number. Here is a plan.
      The house is a narrow one&mdash;only twelve feet wide. There is no
      vestibule. The street door opens directly into a small reception-room. In
      the center of this reception-room stands a table. You want to look out for
      that table, and not knock against it in the dark.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No fear of that,&rsquo; replied Edward Bolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Now look said Bernard Peixada; &rsquo;here is the door that leads out of the
      reception-room. It is a sliding door, always kept open. Over it hangs a
      curtain, which you want to lift up from the bottom: don&rsquo;t shove it aside:
      the rings would rattle on the rod. Beyond this door there is a short
      passage-way see here. And right here, where my pencil points, the stairs
      commence. You go up one flight, and reach the parlors. There are three
      parlors in a line. From the middle parlor a second staircase mounts to the
      sleeping rooms. Now, be sure to remember this: the third step&mdash;I mark
      it with a cross the third step <i>creaks</i>. Understand? It creaks. So,
      in climbing this second flight of stairs, you want to skip the third
      step.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sure,&rsquo; was Edward Bolen&rsquo;s rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well and good. Now you have finished with the second flight of stairs.
      At the head you find yourself in a short, narrow hall. Three doors open
      from this hall. The front door opens into the spare bed-room, now
      unoccupied. The middle door opens into the bath-room. The last door opens
      into the room you want to get at. Which of these doors are you to pass
      through?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The bath-room door.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Precisely. That is the door which your key fits&mdash;not the door that
      leads straight into his room. Well, now observe. Here is the bath-room.
      You unlock the door from the hall into the bath-room, and&mdash;what
      next?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I lock it again, behind me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very well. And then?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then I open the door from the bath-room into the room I&rsquo;m after. That&rsquo;ll
      be unlocked.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Excellent! That will be unlocked. He never locks it. So, finally you are
      in the room you have been making for. Now, study this room carefully. You
      see, the bed stands here; the bureau, here; a sofa, here; the safe, here.
      There are several chairs. You want to look sharp for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be sure to do that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;All right. But the first thing will be to look after him. He&rsquo;ll probably
      wake up the instant you open the door from the bath-room. He&rsquo;s like a
      weasel, for light sleeping. You can&rsquo;t breathe, but he&rsquo;ll wake up. He&rsquo;ll
      wake up, and most likely call out, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there? Is any one there?&rdquo; or
      something of that sort. Don&rsquo;t you answer. Don&rsquo;t you use any threats. You
      can&rsquo;t scare him. Give him time, and he&rsquo;ll make an outcry. Give him a
      chance, and he&rsquo;ll fight. So, you don&rsquo;t want to give him either time or
      chance. The first thing you do, you march straight up to the bed, and
      catch him by the throat; hold him down on the pillow, and clap the sponge
      over his face. Press the sponge hard. One breath will finish his voice.
      Another breath will finish <i>him</i>. Then you&rsquo;ll have things all your
      own way.&mdash;Well, do you know what next?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Next, I&rsquo;m to fasten the sponge tight where it belongs, and pour on more
      of the stuff.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Just so. And next?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m to light the gas.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Right again. And next?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I suppose the job comes next&mdash;hey?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Exactly. You have learned your lesson better than I&rsquo;d have given you
      credit for doing. The job comes next. Now you&rsquo;ve got the gas lit, and him
      quiet, it&rsquo;ll be plain sailing. The safe stands here. It&rsquo;s a small affair,
      three, by three, by two and a half. I&rsquo;ll give you the combination by and
      by. I&rsquo;ve got it up stairs. But first, look here. Here&rsquo;s a plan of the
      inside of the safe. Here&rsquo;s an inside closet, closed by an iron door. No
      matter about that. Here s a row of pigeon-holes, just above it seven of
      them&mdash;see? Now, the fifth pigeon-hole from the right-hand side&mdash;the
      third from the left&mdash;the one marked here with red ink&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the one that you&rsquo;re interested in. All you&rsquo;ll have to do will be to stick
      in your hand and take out every thing that pigeonhole contains&mdash;every
      thing, understand? Don&rsquo;t you stop to examine them. Just lay hold of every
      thing and come away. What I want will be in that pigeon-hole; and if you
      take every thing you can&rsquo;t miss it. Then, as I say, all you&rsquo;ll have left
      to do will be to get out of the house and make tracks for home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And how about him? Shall I loosen the sponge?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, no. Don&rsquo;t stop to do that. He&rsquo;ll come around all right in time; or,
      if he shouldn&rsquo;t, why, small loss!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I reckon I understand the job pretty thoroughly now. I suppose I&rsquo;d
      better be starting.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes. Now wait here a moment. I&rsquo;ll go upstairs and get you the
      combination.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As rapidly as, with my sprained ankle, I could, I returned to my bed. I
      had scarcely touched my head to the pillow, when Bernard Peixada crossed
      the threshold. I lay still, feigning sleep. You may imagine the pitch of
      excitement to which the conversation I had intercepted had worked me up.
      But as yet I had not had time to think it over and determine how to act.
      Crime, theft, perhaps murder even, was brewing. I had been forewarned.
      What could I do to prevent it? Unless I should do something, I should be
      almost an accomplice&mdash;almost as bad as the conspirators themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernard Peixada went at once to the safe, and swung open the heavy door.
      I lay with my back toward him, and was unable, therefore, to watch his
      movements. But I could hear his hands busy with rustling papers. And then,
      all at once, I heard his voice, loud and hoarse, sounding like the
      infuriated shriek of a madman, &rsquo;I have been robbed&mdash;<i>robbed!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a lightning flash, it broke upon me. I knew what the paper I had
      stolen was. I knew what the mysterious figures it bore meant. I had stolen
      the combination that Bernard Peixada had come in quest of! Without that
      combination their scheme of midnight crime could not be carried through!
      It was indispensable to their success. And I had stolen it! I thanked God
      for the impulse that had prompted me to do so. Then I lay still and
      waited. My heart was throbbing so violently, I was actually afraid that
      Bernard Peixada might hear it. I lay still and waited and prayed as I had
      never prayed before. I prayed for strength to win in the battle which, I
      knew, would now j shortly have to be fought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernard Peixada cried out, &rsquo;I have been robbed&mdash;<i>robbed!</i>&rsquo; Then
      for a few seconds he was silent. Then he ran to the entrance of the room
      and shouted, &rsquo;Bolen, Bolen, come here.&rsquo; And when Edward Bolen had obeyed,
      Bernard Peixada led him to the safe and said&mdash;ah, how his harsh voice
      shook!&mdash;said, &rsquo;Look! I have been robbed. The combination is gone. I
      put it in there with my own hands. It is there no longer. It has been
      stolen. Who stole it? If you did, by God, I&rsquo;ll have you hanged!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had slowly and noiselessly turned over in bed. Now, through half closed
      eyes, I could watch the two men. Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s body was trembling from
      head to foot, as if palsy-stricken. His small, black eyes were starting
      from their sockets. His yellow fangs shone hideously behind his parted
      lips. His talons writhed, writhed, writhed. Edward Bolen stood next his
      master, as stolid as an ox. Edward Bolen appeared to be thinking. In a
      little while Edward Bolen shrugged his massive shoulders, lifted his arm,
      pointed to my bed, and spoke one word, &rsquo;<i>Her</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernard Peixada started. &rsquo;What&mdash;my wife?&rsquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ask her,&rsquo; suggested Edward Bolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernard Peixada seemed to hesitate. Finally, approaching my bedside,
      &rsquo;Judith,&rsquo; he called through chattering teeth..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not answer&mdash;but it was not that I meant still to pretend
      sleep. It was that my courage had deserted me. I had no voice. I clenched
      my fists and made my utmost effort to command myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Judith,&rsquo; Bernard Peixada called a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I gathered strength to respond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Judith,&rsquo; Bernard Peixada went on, still all a-tremble, &rsquo;have you&mdash;have
      you taken any papers out of my safe?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What use could lying serve at this crisis? There was sufficient evil in
      action now, without my adding answered, &rsquo;Yes&mdash;I have taken the paper
      you are looking for.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernard Peixada had manifestly not expected such an answer. It took him
      aback. He stood, silent and motionless, glaring at me in astonishment. His
      mouth gaped open, and the lamplight played with his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edward Bolen muttered, &rsquo;Eh! what did I tell you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Bernard Peixada stood motionless and silent only for a
      breathing-space. Suddenly flames leaped to his eyes, color to his cheek. I
      shall not an ineffectual lie to it. I drew a long breath, and transcribe
      the volley of epithets that I had now to sustain from his foul mouth. His
      frame was rigid with wrath. His voice mounted from shrill to shriller. He
      spent himself in a tirade of words. Then he sank into a chair, unable to
      keep his feet from sheer exhaustion. The veins across his forehead stood
      out like great, bloated leeches. His long, black finger-nails kept tearing
      the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edward Bolen waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But eventually Bernard Peixada recovered his forces. Springing to his
      feet, looking hard at me, and pronouncing each word with an evident
      attempt to control his fury, he said, &rsquo;We have no time to waste upon you
      just now, madam. Bolen, here, has business to transact which he must needs
      be about. Afterward I shall endeavor to have an understanding with you. At
      present we will dispose of the matter of prime importance. You don&rsquo;t deny
      that you have stolen a certain paper from my safe. I wish you at once,
      without an instant&rsquo;s delay or hesitation, to tell us what you have done
      with that paper. Where have you put it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to be as calm as he was. &rsquo;I will not tell you,&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A smile that was ominous contracted his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, yes, you will,&rsquo; he said, mockingly, &rsquo;and the sooner you do so, the
      better&mdash;for you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have said, I will not,&rsquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same ominous, sarcastic smile: but suddenly it faded out, and was
      replaced by an expression of alarm. &rsquo;You&mdash;you have not destroyed it?&rsquo;
      he asked, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seemed to me that he had suggested a means for terminating the
      situation. This time, without a qualm, I lied. &rsquo;Yes, I have destroyed it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Good God!&rsquo; he cried, and stood still, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edward Bolen stepped forward. He tugged at Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s elbow. He
      pointed toward me. &rsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, she&rsquo;s lying?&rsquo; he demanded roughly.
      Bernard Peixada started. The baleful light of his black eyes pierced to
      the very marrow of my consciousness. He searched me through and through.
      &rsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he cried, with a great sigh of relief, &rsquo;to be sure, she&rsquo;s lying.&rsquo;
      His yellow teeth gnawed at his under lip: a symptom of busy thinking.
      Finally he said, &rsquo;You have not destroyed it. I advise you to tell us where
      it is. I advise you to lose no time. Where is it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I will not tell you,&rsquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I give you one more chance,&rsquo; he said; &rsquo;where is it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll will not tell you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very well. Then we shall be constrained&mdash;&rsquo; He broke off, and
      whispered a few sentences into Edward Bolen&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edward Bolen nodded, and left the room. Bernard Peixada glared at me. I
      lay still, wondering what the next act was to be, fortifying myself to
      endure and survive the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernard Peixada said, &rsquo;You are going to cause yourself needless pain. You
      may as well speak now as afterward. You&rsquo;ll be as docile as a lamb, in a
      minute or two.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I held my tongue. Presently Edward Bolen returned. He handed something to
      Bernard Peix-ada. Bernard Peixada turned to me. &rsquo;Which one of your
      ankles,&rsquo; he inquired, &rsquo;is it that you are having trouble with?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernard Peixada shrugged his shoulders. &rsquo;Oh, very well,&rsquo; he sneered; &rsquo;it
      won&rsquo;t take long to find out.&rsquo; With that, he seized hold of the bed-clothes
      that covered me, and with a single motion of his arm tossed them upon the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I started up&mdash;attempted to spring from off the bed. He placed his
      hands upon my shoulders, and pushed me back, prostrate. I struggled with
      him. He summoned Edward Bolen to re-enforce him. Edward Bolen was a strong
      man. Edward Bolen had no difficulty in holding me down, flat upon the
      mattress. I watched Bernard Peixada.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernard Peixada took the thing that I had seen Edward Bolen give him&mdash;it
      was a piece of thick twine, perhaps twelve inches in length, and attached
      at each end to a transverse wooden handle&mdash;he took it, and wound it
      about my ankle&mdash;the ankle that was sprained. Then, by means of the
      two wooden handles, he began to twist it around and around&mdash;and at
      every revolution, the twine cut deeper and deeper into my flesh&mdash;and
      at last they pain became more horrible than I could bear&mdash;oh, such
      pain, such fearful pain!&mdash;and I cried out for quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I will tell you any thing you wish to know,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;As I anticipated,&rsquo; was Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s comment. &rsquo;Well, where shall we
      find the paper that you stole?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Loosen that cord, and I will tell you&mdash;I will give it to you,&rsquo; I
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he returned. &rsquo;Give it to me, or tell me where it is, and then I
      will loosen the cord.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is not here&mdash;it&mdash;it is down-stairs,&rsquo; I replied, inspired by
      a sudden hope. If I could only get down-stairs, I thought, I might
      contrive to reach the door that let out of the house. Then, lame though I
      was, and weak and sick, I might, by a supreme effort, elude my persecutors&mdash;attain
      the street&mdash;summon help&mdash;and thus, not only escape myself, but
      defeat the criminal enterprise that they were bent upon. It was a crazy
      notion. At another moment I should have scouted it. But at that moment it
      struck me as wholly rational&mdash;as, at any rate, well worth venturing.
      I did not give myself time to consider it very carefully. It made haste
      from my mind to my lips. &rsquo;The paper,&rsquo; I said, &rsquo;is down-stairs.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Down-stairs?&rsquo; queried Bernard Peixada, tightening the cord a little;
      &rsquo;where down-stairs?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In&mdash;in the parlor&mdash;in the book-case&mdash;shut up in a book,&rsquo;
      I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In what book?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I can not tell you. But I could put my hand upon it, if I were there.
      After I took it from the safe&mdash;you were absent from the house&mdash;I&mdash;oh,
      for mercy&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t tighten that&mdash;I crawled down-stairs&mdash;ah,
      that is better; loosen it a little&mdash;&mdash;I crawled down to the
      parlor&mdash;and&mdash;and shut it up in a book. I don&rsquo;t remember what
      book. But I could find it for you if I were there.&rsquo; In the last quarter
      hour, Mr. Hetzel, I, who had recoiled from lying at the outset, had become
      somewhat of an adept at that art, as you perceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernard Peixada exchanged a glance with Edward Bolen; then said to me,
      &rsquo;All right. Come down-stairs with us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He removed the instrument of torture. A wave of pain more sickening than
      any I had yet endured, swept through my body, as the ligature was relaxed,
      and the blood flowed throbbing back into my disabled foot. I got up and
      hobbled as best I could across the floor, out through the hall, down the
      stairs. Edward Bolen preceded me. Bernard Peixada followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the bottom of the stairs I had to halt and lean against the bannister
      for support. I was weak and faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Go light the gas in the parlor, Bolen,&rsquo; said Bernard Peixada.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bolen went off. Now, I thought, my opportunity had come. The hall-door,
      the door that opened upon the grounds, was in a straight line, not more
      than twenty feet distant from me. I looked at Bernard Peixada. He was
      standing a yard or so to my right, in manifest unconcern. I drew one deep
      breath, mustered my utmost courage, prayed to God for strength, made a
      dash forward, reached the door, despite my lameness, and had my hand upon
      the knob, before Bernard Peixada appeared to realize what had occurred.
      But then&mdash;when he did realize&mdash;then in two bounds he attained my
      side. The next thing I knew, he had grasped my arm with one hand, and had
      twined the fingers of the other hand around my throat. I could feel the
      sharp nails cutting into my flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he cried&mdash;a loud, piercing cry, half of surprise, half of
      triumph. &rsquo;Ah!&rsquo; And then he swore a brutal oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At his touch, Mr. Hetzel, I ceased to be a woman; I became a wild beast.
      It was like a wild beast, that I now fought. Insensible to pain, aware
      only of a fury that was no longer controllable in my breast, I fought
      there with Bernard Peixada in battle royal. Needless to detail our
      maneuvers. I fought with him to such good purpose that ere a great while
      he had to plead for quarter, as I had had to plead up-stairs a few moments
      ago. Quarter I gave him. I flung him away from me. He tottered and fell
      upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I looked around. This was how things stood: Bernard Peixada lay&mdash;half
      lay, half sat&mdash;upon the floor, preparing to get up. Edward Bolen, his
      dull countenance a picture of amazement and stupefaction, was advancing
      toward us from the lower end of the hall. And&mdash;and&mdash;on a chair&mdash;directly
      in front of me&mdash;not two feet away&mdash;together with a hat, a pair
      of overshoes, a bunch of keys, a lantern&mdash;I descried my deliverance&mdash;a
      pistol!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick as thought, I sprang forward. Next moment the pistol was mine.
      Again I looked around. The situation was still much the same. Clasping the
      butt of the pistol firmly in my hand, and gathering what assurance I could
      from the feeling of it, I set out once more to open the door and gain the
      outside of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I was victress now&mdash;indisputably victress. But it
      transpired that I had my claims yet to assert. I slid back the bolts of
      the door, unhindered, it is true; but before I had managed to turn the
      knob and pull the door open, Edward Bolen and Bernard Peixada sprang upon
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a struggle. How long it lasted, I do not know. I heard the
      pistol go off&mdash;a sharp, crashing, deafening report&mdash;once, twice:
      who pulled the trigger, I scarcely knew. Who was wounded, I did not know.
      All was confusion and pain and noise, blood and fire and smoke, horror and
      sickness and bewilderment. I saw nothing&mdash;knew nothing&mdash;understood
      nothing. I was beside myself. It was a delirium. I was helpless&mdash;irresponsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the end, somehow, I got that door open. Through it all, that idea had
      clung in my mind&mdash;to get the door open, somehow, at any cost. Well, I
      got it open. I felt the fresh air upon my cheek, the perfume of the garden
      in my nostrils. The breeze swept in, and cut a path through the smoke, and
      made the gas jets flicker. Then I saw&mdash;I saw that I was free. I saw
      that my persecutors were no longer to be feared. I saw Edward Bolen and
      Bernard Peixada lying prone and bleeding upon the marble pavement at my
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have explained to you, Mr. Hetzel, the circumstances of Bernard
      Peixada&rsquo;s death. It is not necessary for me to dwell upon its
      consequences. At least, I need merely outline them. I need merely tell you
      that in due order I was taken prisoner, tried for Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s
      murder, and acquitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was taken prisoner that very night. Next morning they brought me here&mdash;to
      the same prison that I am again confined in now. Here I was visited by Mr.
      Nathan. I had sent for him, addressing him in care of the sexton of our
      synagogue; and he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him what I have told you. He said I must have a lawyer&mdash;that
      he would engage a lawyer for me. He engaged two lawyers&mdash;Mr. Short
      and Mr. Sondheim. I repeated my story to them. They listened. When I had
      done, they laughed. I asked them why they laughed. They replied that,
      though my story was unquestionably true, no jury would believe it. They
      said the lawyer for the prosecution would mix me upon cross-examination,
      and turn my defense to ridicule. They said I should have to plead lunacy.
      I need not detain you with a rehearsal of the dispute I had with Messrs.
      Short and Sondheim. Eventually&mdash;in deference chiefly to the urging of
      Mr. Nathan&mdash;I consented to let them take their own course. So I was
      led to court, and tried, and acquitted. It would be useless for me to go
      over my trial again now in this letter. I shall say enough when I say that
      it was conducted in the same room that I had to plead in this morning&mdash;that
      the room was crowded&mdash;that I had to sit there all day long, for two
      mortal days, and listen to the lawyers, and the witnesses, and the judge,
      and support the gaze of a multitude of people. If it had not been for Mr.
      Nathan, I don&rsquo;t know how I should have lived through the ordeal. But he
      sat by me from beginning to end, and held my hand, and inspired me with
      strength and hope. My mother, meantime, I had not seen. Mr. Nathan said
      she was away from the city, visiting with friends, whom he named; and
      added that it would be kinder not to let her know what was going on. After
      my release, Mr. Nathan confessed that, thinking I had already enough to
      bear, he had deceived me. My mother had been sick; while my trial was in
      progress, she had died. Well, at last the trial was over, and the jury had
      declared me not guilty, and the prison people let me go. Mr. Nathan and I
      went together to an apartment he had rented in Sixty-third Street. Thither
      came Messrs. Short and Sondheim, and made me sign numberless papers&mdash;the
      nature of which I did not inquire into&mdash;and after a while I
      understood that I had inherited a great deal of money from Bernard Peixada&mdash;more
      than a hundred thousand dollars. This money I asked Mr. Nathan to dispose
      of, so that it might do some good. He invested it, and made arrangements
      to have the income divided between a hospital, an orphan asylum, a home
      for working women, an industrial school, and a society for the protection
      of children who are treated cruelly by their parents. (I have just now
      received a paper with a red seal on it, from which I learn that Bernard
      Peixada left a will, and that the money I have spoken of will have to be
      paid over to his brother.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That winter&mdash;the winter of 1879-80&mdash;Mr. Nathan and I spent
      alone together. For the first time since the day on which my father had
      told me I must marry Bernard Peixada, for the first time, I began to have
      a feeling of peace, and repose, and security. Mr. Nathan was so good to me&mdash;oh,
      such a good, kind, tender friend, Mr. Hetzel&mdash;that I became almost
      happy. It was almost a happiness just to spend my time near to Mr. Nathan&mdash;he
      was so gentle, so strong; he made me feel so safe, so far away from the
      storm and the darkness of the past. Was I not tormented by remorse? Did I
      not repent having taken two human lives? Not for one instant. I held
      myself wholly irresponsible. If Bernard Peixada and Edward Bolen had died
      by my hand, it was their own fault, their own doing. No, I did not suffer
      the faintest pang of remorse. Only, now and then I would remember&mdash;now
      and then the night of July 30th would re enact itself in my memory&mdash;and
      then I would shudder and grow sick at heart; but that was not remorse. It
      was disgust and horror. Of course I do not mean that I was happy in a
      positive sense, this winter. Real happiness I never knew until I met
      Arthur. But I was less unhappy than I had been for a long, long while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in the early spring Mr. Nathan died. The last person I had left to
      care for, the last person who cared for me, the man who had stood as a
      rock of strength for me to lean upon, to whom I had perhaps been too much
      of a burden, but whom I had loved as a woman in my relation to him must
      needs have loved him&mdash;this man died. I was absolutely alone in the
      world. That was a dreary, desolate spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon after his death, I received a paper something like this paper with
      the red seal that I have received to-day. I found that he had made a will
      and left me all his money. My doctor said I needed a change. I went to
      Europe. I traveled alone in Europe for some months, trying to forget
      myself in sight-seeing&mdash;in constant motion. At last I settled down in
      Vienna, and devoted myself to studying music. I staid about a year in
      Vienna. Then a spirit of restlessness seized upon me. I left Vienna and
      went to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In London I met Mrs. Hart. We became friends at once. She was about to
      make a short trip on the Continent, before returning to America. She asked
      me to accompany her. I said I would go to the Continent with her, but that
      I could not return to America. She wanted to know why. I answered by
      telling her a little something of my recent history. I said, &rsquo;In America I
      am Judith Peixada&mdash;the notorious woman who killed her husband. Here I
      am unknown. So I will remain here.&rsquo; She asked, &rsquo;How old are you?&rsquo; I said,
      &rsquo;Twenty-three, nearing twenty-four.&rsquo; She said, &rsquo;You are a child. You have
      a long life before you. You are wasting it, moping about in this aimless
      way here in Europe. Come home with me. Nobody shall recognize you for
      Judith Peixada. I will give you a new name. You shall be Ruth Lehmyl. Ruth
      Lehmyl was the name of my daughter who is dead. You may guess how dearly I
      love you, when I ask you to take my daughter&rsquo;s name. Come home and live
      with me, Ruth, and make me happy.&rsquo;&mdash;As you know, I was prevailed
      upon. After a month or two spent at Aix-les-Bains, we came back to
      America. We dwelt for a while in an apartment on Fifty-ninth Street. Last
      April we moved into Beekman Place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This brings me to the second point. Why, with that dark stain upon my
      past&mdash;why, being Judith Peixada, for all my change of name&mdash;why
      did I consent to become Arthur Ripley&rsquo;s wife? Oh, Mr. Hetzel, it was
      because I loved him. I was a woman, and I loved him, and I was weak. He
      said that he loved me, that it would break his heart if I should refuse
      him; and I could not help it. I tried hard. I tried to act against my
      heart. I told him that my life had not been what he might wish it to be. I
      begged him to go away. But he said that he cared nothing for the past, and
      he urged me and pleaded with me, and I&mdash;I loved him so the temptation
      was so strong&mdash;it was as if he had opened the gates of heaven and
      invited me to enter&mdash;I caught a glimpse of the great joy&mdash;of the
      great sorrow, too, of the sorrow that would follow to him and to me if I
      sent him away&mdash;and my strength was insufficient&mdash;and we were
      married.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very tired, Mr. Hetzel. I have been writing for so long a time that
      my fingers are cramped, and my back aches from bending over, and my body
      has become chilled through by sitting still in this damp place, and my
      head is thick and heavy. Yet I have some things still left to say. You
      must pardon me if I am stupid and roundabout in coming to the point. And
      if I do not succeed in making what I have on my mind very clear to you,
      you must excuse me on the ground that I am quite worn out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I have said, I was frank with Arthur Ripley. I warned him that my past
      life had been darkened by sin. I said, &rsquo;If you knew about it, you would
      not care to marry me.&rsquo; He retorted, The past is dead. You and I have just
      been born.&rsquo; It did indeed seem so to me&mdash;as though I had just been
      born. I allowed myself to be persuaded. We were married. But then, Mr.
      Hetzel, as soon as I had yielded, I said to Arthur, &rsquo;It is not right that
      I, your betrothed, should keep a secret from you. I will tell you the
      whole story.&rsquo; I said this to him on more than one occasion before we were
      married. And I repeated it again and again afterward. But every time that
      I broached the subject, he put it aside. He answered, &rsquo;No. Keep your
      secret as a reminder of my unwavering confidence and perfect love.&rsquo; I
      supposed that he was sincere. I marveled at his generosity, and loved him
      all the better, because of it. Yet what was the truth? The truth was that
      in his inmost heart? he could not help wishing to know what his wife&rsquo;s
      secret was. But he played the hypocrite. He forbade me to tell it to him&mdash;forbade
      me to unseal my lips&mdash;and so got the credit for great magnanimity.
      Then, behind my back, he associated with Benjamin Peixada, and learned
      from his lips&mdash;not my secret&mdash;no, but the false, distorted
      version of it, which Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s brother would delight to give. What
      Benjamin Peixada told him, he believed; and it was worse than he had
      bargained for. When he understood that his wife had committed <i>murder</i>,
      that his wife had stood, a common criminal, at the bar of the court of
      General Sessions, lo! all the love that he had boasted, died an instant
      death. And then&mdash;this is what is most infamous&mdash;then he
      contrived a cruel method of letting me know that he knew. Instead of
      coming to me, and telling me in a straightforward way, he put that
      advertisement into the paper. That, I do think, was infamous. And all the
      time, he was pretending that he loved me, and I was believing him, and
      treating him as a wife treats her husband. I read that advertisement, and
      was completely deceived by it. I went to Benjamin Peixada&rsquo;s place. &rsquo;What
      do you wish with me?&rsquo; I asked. He answered, &rsquo;Wait a little while, and the
      gentleman who wrote that advertisement will come and explain to you. Wait
      a little while, and I promise you a considerable surprise.&rsquo; I waited. The
      gentleman came. The gentleman was Arthur. Not content with having decoyed
      me to that place in that way, he&mdash;he called me by that name&mdash;he
      called me Mrs. Peixada! The surprise was considerable, I confess. And yet,
      you and Mrs. Hart wonder that I am indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course, I understand that Arthur had no share in causing my
      arrest. I understand that all he intended was to confront me there in
      Benjamin Peixada&rsquo;s office, and inform me that he knew who I was, and
      denounce me, and repudiate me. But Benjamin Peixada had a little plan of
      his own to carry through. When Arthur saw what it was&mdash;when he saw
      that Benjamin Peixada had set a trap for me, and that I was to be taken
      away to prison&mdash;then he was shocked and pained, and felt sorry for
      what he had helped to do. You don&rsquo;t need to explain that to me. That is
      not why I feel the deep resentment toward him which, I admit, I do feel.
      The bare fact that he pried into my secrets behind my back, and went on
      pretending to love me at the same time, shows me that he never truly loved
      me. You speak of my seeing him. It would be useless for me to see him. He
      could not undo what he has done. All the explanations and excuses that he
      could make, would not alter the fact that he went to work without my
      knowledge, and found out what I had again and again volunteered to tell
      him. If he suffers from supposing that I think he had a share in causing
      my imprisonment, you may tell him that I think no such thing. Tell him
      that I understand perfectly every thing that he could say. Tell him that a
      meeting between us would only be productive of fresh pain for each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hetzel, if you were a woman, and if you had ever gone through the
      agony of a public trial for murder in a crowded court-room, and if all at
      once you beheld before you the prospect of going through that agony for a
      second time, I am sure you would grasp eagerly at any means within your
      reach by which to escape it. That is the case with me. I am a woman. I
      have been tried for murder once&mdash;publicly tried, in a crowded
      court-room. I would rather spend all the rest of my life in prison, than
      be tried again. That is why I pleaded guilty this morning. If there were
      any future to look forward to&mdash;if Arthur had acted differently&mdash;if
      things were not as they are&mdash;then, perhaps&mdash;but it is useless to
      say perhaps. I have nothing to live for&mdash;nothing worth purchasing at
      the price of another trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does any thing remain for me to say? I do not think of any thing. I hope
      I have made what I had to say clear enough. I beg that you will forgive
      me, if I have trespassed beyond the limits of friendship, in writing at
      such length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth Ripley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Julian Hetzel, 43 Beekman Place.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XII.&mdash;&ldquo;THE FINAL STATE O&rsquo; THE STORY.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N Thursday, August
      14th, at about half, past one in the afternoon,
      Assistant-district-attorney Romer was seated in his office, poring over a
      huge law-book&rsquo;, and smoking a huge cigar, when the door suddenly flew
      open, and in came, or more accurately, in burst Mr. Julian Hetzel. In one
      hand Hetzel carried a dripping umbrella; the other hand was thrust deep
      into the breast of its owner&rsquo;s coat. Hetzel&rsquo;s face wore an expression of
      intense excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romer lifted his eyes from off his law-book, removed his cigar from
      between his lips, and ejaculated, &ldquo;Hello! What&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel hurried straight ahead, till he had reached the edge of Romer&rsquo;s
      desk. Then, extracting a ponderous envelope from the inner pocket of his
      coat, he threw it emphatically down upon Romer&rsquo;s blotting pad, and cried,
      &ldquo;Read that&mdash;will you?&mdash;and tell me what you think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Romer picked the envelope up, looked inquiringly at its superscription,
      inserted thumb, and forefinger, drew out its contents, unfolded the same,
      turned to the beginning, scanned perhaps the first dozen lines, stopped,
      ran the pages rapidly over to the end, found the signature, then glanced
      up, and asked, &ldquo;Are you in a hurry? Have you plenty of time to spare?
      Because it&rsquo;s a pretty serious undertaking&mdash;to read this through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&mdash;give it to me,&rdquo; returned Hetzel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been over it once, and
      got familiar with the handwriting. I&rsquo;ll read it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel read Ruth Ripley&rsquo;s letter aloud to Romer. The reading consumed
      rather more than an hour. Not once did Romer interrupt, or Hetzel pause.
      At the end, the two men looked at each other in silence. By and by Romer&rsquo;s
      lips opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By&mdash;by God!&rdquo; was all he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he began to pace uneasily to and fro across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; asked Hetzel, &ldquo;do you think that that&rsquo;s the sort of a woman to be
      left locked up in the Tombs prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens and earth!&rdquo; cried Romer; and continued his promenade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the question is,&rdquo; said Hetzel, &ldquo;whether she&rsquo;s to be left there in the
      Tombs. In view of what she has written down in those papers, can&rsquo;t we get
      her out? I want to take her home before nightfall to-day. It seems to me,
      it&rsquo;s an outrage upon humanity for her to remain locked up an hour longer.
      You&rsquo;re acquainted with the practical side of this kind of thing. Now, give
      me your opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Romer knitted his brows, and kept on moving back and forth, up and down
      the room, Gradually, pendulum-fashion, the space covered at each turn
      shortened somewhat; until finally coming to a standstill, Romer said,
      &ldquo;Yes, by Jove! You&rsquo;re right. She sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;. spend another night in that place
      if I can help it; and I think I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good and the less time lost, the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I mean to do,&rdquo; said Romer, &ldquo;is this. I mean to take a pretty big
      responsibility upon my shoulders, but I guess I&rsquo;m safe in doing so. I&rsquo;m
      sure Mr. Orson would approve, if he were here; and as long as he isn&rsquo;t
      here, I&rsquo;m going to act on that assumption, and run the chances of getting
      his approval after the fact. The homicide that that woman committed&mdash;why,
      it was a clear case of self-defense. And what I&rsquo;m going to take the
      responsibility of doing is this. I shall send down to the Tombs and have
      her brought up here&mdash;to my office&mdash;without a moment&rsquo;s delay.
      While the officers are gone after her, I&rsquo;ll run into court and speak
      privately to the judge. I&rsquo;ll lay these facts before him, and tell him that
      we, the People, are convinced that it was a plain case of justifiable
      homicide; and I&rsquo;ll ask him to let her withdraw her plea of guilty, and
      enter one of not guilty, right away. He can&rsquo;t refuse, if I put it on that
      ground. I&rsquo;ll ask him, moreover, as a personal favor to me, to have the
      court-room cleared of people, so that she? won&rsquo;t be obliged to face the
      music again to-day, as she was yesterday. I can&rsquo;t promise that he&rsquo;ll agree
      to this; but it isn&rsquo;t at all impossible. Well and good. I&rsquo;ll make these
      arrangements before she arrives. When she does arrive, I&rsquo;ll talk to her.
      You leave me to do the talking. Then we&rsquo;ll go with her into the judge&rsquo;s
      presence, and have her do what&rsquo;s necessary there. And then, in your sight
      and in hers, so that all doubt on that score will be cleared away for good
      and all, I&rsquo;ll <i>nolle</i> the indictment! That is to say, I&rsquo;ll render the
      indictment null and void by indorsing upon it a <i>nol. pros</i>.,
      together with a memorandum to the effect that the district-attorney is
      persuaded of the defendant&rsquo;s innocence. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hetzel, &ldquo;I think I understand. And if you can only succeed in
      doing this, we&mdash;we&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo; Hetzel&rsquo;s voice broke. Before he was
      able to recover it, Romer had left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour, or thereabouts, elapsed. Hetzel waited as patiently as he
      could&mdash;which is not saying much. Every five minutes, he had out his
      watch. It was nearly half past three when at last Romer reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Hetzel made haste to inquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Romer, &ldquo;congratulate me! The judge agrees to do every thing,
      just as I wished. At first he was disposed to hesitate. Then I read him
      that part where she describes the application of the torture. That
      finished him. They&rsquo;re just winding up a larceny case at this moment. He&rsquo;s
      on the point of sentencing the prisoner. After that&rsquo;s over, he&rsquo;ll have the
      court-room emptied, and be ready for us. She ought to get here any minute
      now, and&mdash;&rdquo; Romer paused; for, at this moment, the door of his office
      opened, and Mrs. Ripley entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She halted just across the threshold, looked from Romer to Hetzel, bowed
      slightly to the latter, and then stood still in passive attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romer advanced toward her, and said, very gently, &ldquo;I beg of you, Mrs.
      Ripley, to come in and sit down. I have something to say, and I shall
      thank you very much if you will listen. Sit down here in this easy-chair.&mdash;There.&mdash;Now,
      when you are ready, I&rsquo;ll speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; she said. Her voice was faint and weak. She leaned back in
      her chair, as though feeble and exhausted. Her face was intensely white&mdash;snow-white
      beneath its coronet of raven hair. There were large, dark circles under
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Ripley,&rdquo; began Romer&mdash;then hesitated&mdash;then began anew,
      &ldquo;Mrs. Ripley, I&mdash;that is, Mr. Hetzel&mdash;Mr. Hetzel has given me
      the letter you wrote him yesterday, and I have read it. I dare not trust
      myself to&mdash;to say what&mdash;to say any thing about it, more than
      this, that we&mdash;the district-attorney&rsquo;s office&mdash;that we are
      sorry, very, very sorry for all that has happened&mdash;for all that you
      have been made to suffer these last few days, and that&mdash;that we are
      anxious to do every thing in our power to make amends. Of course I know we
      never can make amends in full. I know that. We can&rsquo;t undo what has been
      done&mdash;can&rsquo;t cure the pain that you&rsquo;ve already had to bear. But&mdash;but
      we can spare you&mdash;we can save you from having to suffer any more
      pain, and&mdash;and then, you know, being ignorant of the real truth, as
      we were, it wasn&rsquo;t altogether our fault, was it? No; the original fault
      lay with your lawyers, Short and Sondheim, when you were first tried,
      years ago. They&mdash;they ought to have been strung and quartered,
      because, if they had had you tell your story to the district-attorney
      then, and if you had told it in its completeness, as you have in this
      letter, why&mdash;why, nobody would have doubted your innocence for a
      moment, and you would have been spared no end of trouble and sorrow and
      mortification. But that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. It&rsquo;s too late to
      complain of Short and Sondheim. They have an inborn antipathy to the
      truth, and always fight as shy of it as they can. There&rsquo;s no use raking up
      bygones. The point is now that we want to set you at liberty as quickly as
      possible. That&rsquo;s the most we can do. We mean to <i>nolle</i> the
      indictment against you&mdash;which will be as complete an exoneration as
      an acquittal by a jury and an honorable discharge by a judge would be.
      That&rsquo;s what we intend to do. But first&mdash;before we can do that&mdash;first,
      you know, you will have to untie our hands by withdrawing the plea that
      you put in yesterday, and by entering in place of it a plea of not guilty.
      Then you&rsquo;ll be a free woman. Then you can go home with Mr. Hetzel, here,
      and rest assured that you&rsquo;ll never be troubled any more about the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth sat perfectly still in her chair. Her great, melancholy eyes were
      fixed upon the wall in front of her. She made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Romer said, after having waited in vain for her to speak, &ldquo;now, if
      you will be so good, I should like to have you come with me into the court
      room, in order, you know, to do what I have said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this, Ruth winced perceptibly. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, very low, &ldquo;must&mdash;must
      I go into court again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this time,&rdquo; explained Romer, &ldquo;it will not be as hard for you as it
      was before. There&rsquo;ll be, no spectators and no red tape. You&rsquo;ll tell the
      judge that you withdraw your plea of guilty, and plead not guilty, and
      he&rsquo;ll say all right; and then you&rsquo;ll see me <i>nolle</i> the indictment;
      and then it will all be over for good; and, as I&rsquo;ve said, you&rsquo;ll go home
      with Mr. Hetzel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth rose, bowed to Romer, and said, &ldquo;I am ready to follow you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any objection to my accompanying you?&rdquo; Hetzel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; come along,&rdquo; said Romer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every thing befell substantially as Romer had predicted. They found the
      judge presiding over an empty court-room. His honor came down informally
      from the bench, bade Mrs. Ripley be seated, said laughingly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll act as
      clerk and judge both,&rdquo; went to the clerk&rsquo;s desk, possessed himself of pen,
      ink, and paper, rattled off <i>sotto voce,</i> &ldquo;You, Judith Peixada, do
      hereby&rdquo;&mdash;mumble, mumble, mumble&mdash;&ldquo;and enter in lieu of the same&rdquo;&mdash;mumble,
      mumble&mdash;&ldquo;upon the indictment;&rdquo; threw down his pen, got up, added in a
      loud, hearty voice, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all, madam: good day,&rdquo; bowed, and left the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later Ruth was seated at Hetzel&rsquo;s side in a carriage; and
      the carriage was making at top-speed for Beekman Place. After they had
      driven for half a dozen blocks in silence, Hetzel began, &ldquo;Mrs. Ripley, I
      am sorry to disturb you. I suppose you are so tired that you would rather
      not be talked to. But there is something which you must hear before we
      reach home; and I must beg of you to give me permission to say it now&mdash;at
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say any thing you wish. I will listen to any thing you wish to say.&rdquo; Her
      voice was that of a woman whose spirit has been quite broken and subdued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, the upshot of what I have to say is just this. Don&rsquo;t for a
      moment imagine that I mean to reproach you. Under the circumstances&mdash;considering
      the shock and the pain of your situation last Monday&mdash;you weren&rsquo;t to
      be blamed for jumping to a false conclusion. But now, at last, you are in
      a position to see things as they truly are. What I want to say is what
      Mrs. Hart wanted to say when she visited you on Tuesday. It is that Arthur&mdash;that
      your husband&mdash;had no more idea, when he put that advertisement into
      the papers, that you were Judith Peixada, than I had, or than the most
      indifferent person in the world had. When you fancy that he had been
      trying to find out your secrets behind your back, you do him a&mdash;a
      tremendous injustice. He never would be capable of such a thing. Arthur is
      the frankest, honestest fellow that ever lived. He doesn&rsquo;t know what
      deception means. The amount of the matter was simply this. He had been
      retained by Mr. Peixada to hunt up his brother&rsquo;s widow. In order to
      accomplish this, he resorted to a device which, I suppose, precedents
      seemed to justify, though it strikes me as a pretty shabby one,
      notwithstanding&mdash;he advertised. And when he went to meet Mrs. Peixada
      in his client&rsquo;s office, and found that she and you were one and the same
      person, why, he was as much astonished as&mdash;as I was when he came home
      and told me about it. There&rsquo;s the long and short of the story in a
      nutshell. The detail of it you&rsquo;ll learn when you talk it over with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetzel waited, expecting Ruth to speak. But she did not speak for a long
      while. She sat rigid in her corner, with pale face and downcast eyes. At
      last, however, her lips opened. In a whisper, &ldquo;Will&mdash;will he ever
      forgive me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive you?&rdquo; repeated Hetzel. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t feel that he has any thing to
      forgive you for. On the other hand, he hopes for your forgiveness&mdash;hopes
      you will forgive him for having refused to let you speak. It was a
      coincidence and a mistake. He loves you. When that is said, every thing is
      said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For another long while Ruth kept silence. As the carriage turned into
      Fiftieth Street, she straightened up, and drew a deep, tremulous breath.
      After a brief moment of hesitation, she said, &ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose he is
      waiting for us&mdash;yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Hetzel answered, &ldquo;that reminds me. You&mdash;you see, the fact is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thereupon the poor fellow had to break the news of Arthur&rsquo;s illness to
      her, as best he could. Beginning with that hour, the trained nurse had an
      indefatigable companion in her vigils.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br /> <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning Ruth said to Hetzel, &ldquo;To-day is the day fixed for the probate
      of Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s will. Do you think it is necessary that I should go
      to the court?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Hetzel, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t care. You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;. do so. I&rsquo;ll
      be your proxy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to the surrogate&rsquo;s office. When he returned home, he said, &ldquo;Well,
      Mrs. Ripley, the enemy has had his Waterloo! The orphan asylum and the
      home for working-girls will continue to enjoy Bernard Peixada&rsquo;s wealth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how is that?&rdquo; Ruth questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The will fell through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fell through? Was it a forgery? Or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t a forgery, but it was a holograph. That is to say, the
      testator was rash enough to draw it himself&mdash;without the assistance
      of a lawyer; and so he contrived to make a fatal blunder. It seems that
      the law requires a person, upon signing his will, to explain explicitly to
      the witnesses the nature of the document&mdash;that it <i>is</i> a will,
      and not a deed, or a contract, or what not. And that is precisely what Mr.
      Peixada fortunately omitted to do. The witnesses swore that he had said
      nothing whatever concerning the character of the instrument&mdash;that he
      had simply requested them to attest his signature, and then had folded the
      paper up, and put it into his pocket. The lawyer&mdash;Arthur&rsquo;s successor&mdash;pressed
      them pretty hard, but they weren&rsquo;t to be shaken; and the clerk thereupon
      declared that the will was void and valueless; and then there was a lot of
      excitement; and I came away; and that&rsquo;s how the case stands at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so the money will remain where it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely; though I should think the man to whom it once belonged would
      turn in his grave, at the thought of the good it&rsquo;s doing. This is the sort
      of thing that helps one to believe in an avenging angel, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br /> <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      One Sunday afternoon, toward the middle of September, Ruth was very happy.
      The crisis of Arthur&rsquo;s illness, Dr. Letzup vouched, had passed. His
      delirium had subsided. He had fallen into a placid slumber. With proper
      care and vigilant guarding against a relapse, the doctor thought, he ought
      to be upon his feet within a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, it was natural that Ruth&rsquo;s heart should sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, especially when one is a songstress by birth and training, a singing
      heart is apt to induce sympathetic action on the part of the voice. Ruth
      was seated at the window in the room adjoining Arthur&rsquo;s, listening to her
      heart&rsquo;s song, when, most likely without her being conscious of it, a soft,
      sweet strain of melody began to flow from her lips. It was very low and
      gentle, and yet, as the event proved, it was loud enough to arouse the
      invalid from his much needed sleep. The nurse came bustling in from the
      sick room, with finger raised in warning, and exclaimed in a whisper,
      &ldquo;Hush&mdash;hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh! You&rsquo;ve gone and waked him up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible that she had so far forgotten herself? Oh, dear, dear! Her
      regret bordered upon despair. Yet, with the impetuosity that is
      characteristic of her sex, she could not stop there, and let bad enough
      alone, but must needs be guilty of still further imprudence, and march
      bodily into the sick man&rsquo;s presence, and up close to his bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay with open eyes looking straight ceiling-ward. But at the moment of
      her entrance he turned his gaze full upon her, and a happy smile lighted
      up his wan, wasted face. He did not attempt to speak. Neither did she. But
      she bent over him, and kissed him once upon the forehead, and rewarded his
      smile with a glance of infinite tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his lips moved. &ldquo;Was&mdash;was it all a dream&mdash;my meeting you in
      Peixada&rsquo;s office, and all the rest?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;all a dream?&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes and went to sleep again. When Dr. Letzup called that
      evening, &ldquo;Better and better!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What panacea have you been
      administering during my absence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br /> <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday, October 18th, the steamship Alcibiades, Captain Gialsamino,
      of the Florio line, sailed from its berth in Brooklyn, and pointed its
      prow towards Naples. Inscribed on the passenger-list were the names: &ldquo;M.
      and Mme. A. Ripli.&rdquo; Monsieur and Madame Ripley were bent upon wintering in
      Italy. They have remained abroad ever since. Arthur talks in his letters
      of coming home next spring, though what he will do when he gets here, I
      don&rsquo;t know, for he has registered a solemn vow never again to practice
      law.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
